3. Annotate a subset of the articles for sentiment towards Ukraine and the presence of propaganda using the ChatGPT-3.5-turbo API.
4. Perform topic modeling to discover the main themes and topics discussed in the articles.
5. Apply named entity recognition to identify key entities such as persons, organizations, and locations mentioned in the articles.
6. Train and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment analysis and propaganda detection.
7. Analyze the results to identify patterns, biases, and narratives in the media coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war.
8. The data collection process resulted in a diverse and representative sample of news articles related to the Russia-Ukraine war from influential media outlets in the selected countries. This dataset forms the foundation for our sentiment analysis and investigation of media biases and narratives.
