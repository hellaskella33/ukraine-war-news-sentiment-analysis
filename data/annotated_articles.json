It called them \"cruel\" and \"unconscionable\" and urged for them to stop.\n\nRescuers from Ukraine's State Emergencies Service DSNS often arrive to deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks before everyone else, and they also say the threat of repeat strikes is becoming ever more frequent.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the tactic of double-tapping has been used increasingly often recently. This is difficult to comprehend. The Russians have no right to do this,\" DSNS spokesman Oleksandr Khorunzhy told the BBC.\n\n\"They know perfectly well what they're doing, and not just to rescuers, police officers, utility workers or medics. This affects ordinary civilians,\" Mr Khorunzhy said.\n\nHe called double-taps \"utterly immoral\".\n\n\"I can't wrap my head around this, it's just inhuman,\" he said. \"They see perfectly well that unarmed rescuers are the first to arrive at the sites of their attacks.\"\n\nThe DSNS says 91 of its rescuers have been killed and more than 340 injured since the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nKira Oves was one of the journalists injured in the Zaporizhzhia double-tap attack.\n\nShe told the BBC that she had just arrived at the scene of a strike when she heard a whistling sound.\n\n\"A colleague shouted: Incoming! On the ground!\"\n\nShe crouched and heard a massive explosion. She only realised that she was wounded after she felt blood streaming down her face. She and her colleague ran to what they thought was a safe place - only to hear another \"enormous blast\".",

The enemy is also concentrating efforts to break through our defenses west of Bakhmut, exit to the Siverskyi Donets - Donbas channel, capture the settlement of Chasiv Yar, and create conditions for further advance to the Kramatorsk agglomeration,\" Syrskyi said.\n\nHe emphasized that the heroic defense of the Ukrainian brigades prevents the Russians from implementing their plans.\n\n\"Using a numerical advantage and various motivational factors, including executions, separate groups of the enemy's infantry advanced to the Novyi neighborhood, but were destroyed by FPV kamikaze drone strikes and artillery fire,\" the general said.\n\nAt the same time, Syrskyi said, the threat remains relevant, given that Russia's top military leadership has tasked their troops with capturing Chasiv Yar by May 9.\n\n\"To respond adequately to the actions of the enemy and strengthen the defense of our troops in this direction, measures have been taken to significantly strengthen the brigades with ammunition, drones, and electronic warfare,\" the commander-in-chief said.\n\nAccording to him, the main conclusion from his two-day work at the front is the need to improve the quality of training, including the moral and psychological component, to increase the number of high-tech unmanned systems for various purposes with trained operators, and to improve the quality of conducting asymmetric operations to reduce the combat potential of the Russians.\n\n\"We continue to carry out organizational measures with an emphasis on increasing the efficiency of management, eliminating duplication, and directing freed resources to support combat units and sub-units. The main task of these measures is to increase the combat capability of our troops, save the lives of our soldiers, disrupt the enemy's plans, and ensure the training of reserves,\" Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi said on April 13 that the situation on the eastern front had worsened significantly in recent days.\n\nPhoto credit: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine",

Those trolls, he added, generate loads of comments, but in reality it is just several people who engage in communicating on behalf of dozens of accounts. These comments are part of Russia's big information war, the journalist said.\n\nAccording to Cernea, he must literally prove to his audience what he saw at the front with his own eyes.\n\nThere are still many in Romania who do not act directly in favor of Russia, but try to put Ukraine in the shade, trying to confuse people. We need to understand this and resist,\" said Chernea.\n\nThe Romanian journalist also noted that Ukrainian military administrations should communicate more closely with the press. \"It is important that foreigners have the opportunity to see the truth about Ukraine and be deeply aware of the developments at the front, because this also affects the situation around weapon supplies. Truth and power are on the side of Ukraine. And we must directly show who is to blame for this war, so that no one has any doubts about this,\" the Romanian journalist emphasized.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, the Second Black Sea Security Conference, hosted by Sofia, was jointly organized by Ukraine and Bulgaria. The conference is the flagship event of the Crimea Platform and the main stage for exploring solutions to security problems in the Black Sea region. Partners of the conference are Media Center Ukraine and the Crimean Human Rights Group.\n\nThe event is attended by international experts, representatives of the governments of the International Crimea Platform member states and international institutions. The participants discussed strategies for responding to regional security threats, as well as actions Ukraine should take in order to successfully repel Russian aggression in the Black Sea region.\n\nPhoto: Kyrylo Yevseyev",

From the beginning of this year, Russian forces took over 360 square kilometers,\" analysts said.\n\nThe Institute of War Research alerted that \"delaying or suspending military assistance would lead to the dramatic profits of Russia in 2024 and 2025 and ultimately to its victory.\"According to analysts, America has only two real possibilities to choose from.One of them is a quick resumption of military aid, which will translate into stabilizing the front line.However, the alternative is to allow Russia to defeat the Ukrainian army and move towards NATO borders from the Black Sea to Central Poland.\"There is no third option,\" it was emphasized.\n\nRussia will win in Ukraine?The consequences could reach Poland\n\nAccording to ISW, the possible victory of Russia in Ukraine would have destructive consequences for NATO defense.On the other hand, the success of Ukraine, even in the case of maintaining the current line of the front, would hinder the potential attack of Russia on Poland or the Baltic States.\"Russian military leaders planning the invasion of the Baltic States or an attack on Poland will have to assume that Ukraine can proceed to such a war on behalf of NATO, regardless of membership status,\" ISW analysts informed.\n\nThere is also a fear that in the event of Russia's victory, it may threaten NATO from the territory of Ukraine, due to the use of its industry and forcing citizens to fight against the alliance.\"Therefore, in this terrible scenario, NATO must expect a clash with large Russian conventional forces on its entire border from the Black Sea to the Arctic, which for the first time exposes the southern borders of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania to the risk of Russian land attack from the fall of the Soviet Union\" - experts pointed out.\n\nPoliticians also alert about the terrible situation in Ukraine.The head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Representatives Michael McCaul recently stated that \"Kharkiv is on the verge of fall.\"Russia also has plans for the lands west of Bachmut in the area of time Jar.The Ukrainian General Oleksandr Syrski announced that the Russian army is to take this area until May 9, i.e. until the day of victory, which would be a war symbol.More information on this subject can be found in the article: \"Alarming news on Ukraine.

        "content": "CAPRI, Italy (AP) \u2014 Top NATO and European Union officials urged foreign ministers from leading industrialized nations on Thursday to take quick, concrete steps to provide more air defense systems and artillery to Ukraine, warning that continued delays could tilt the war in Moscow\u2019s favor.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell addressed a meeting of foreign ministers of G7 nations meeting on the Italian resort island of Capri. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and surging tensions in the Middle East over Iran\u2019s unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend have topped the agenda of the gathering.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US WILL '100%' STAY IN NATO IF ALLIANCE TREATS AMERICA 'FAIRLY'\n\nWithout more Patriot air defense missile systems to protect against Russian strikes, \"the electricity system of Ukraine will be destroyed. And no country can fight without having electricity at home, in the factories, in the front line,\" Borrell told reporters on the sidelines of the event.\n\nStoltenberg welcomed signs that the U.S. Congress might soon vote on a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, the bulk of which would go to purchasing weapons and ammunitions from U.S. defense manufacturers. And he welcomed other recent financial pledges from the Netherlands and Denmark as well as Germany's recent announced delivery of a new Patriot missile battery.\n\nBut he said more long-term and sustainable aid was necessary to better coordinate Ukraine's response over the long term.\n\n\"There is an urgent, critical need for more air defense,\" Stoltenberg said, adding that artillery rounds were also needed. \"We cannot continue to be in a situation where Russia is outgunning Ukraine, in the way they do now. The Russians are shooting and shooting, and the Ukrainians have limited resources to shoot back. So the Ukrainians need more, and that\u2019s the urgent and important message from me to all allies.\"\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani opened the first working session by calling for new sanctions against Iran for its weekend attack and concrete help for Ukraine. \"If Ukraine loses, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will never sit at the peace table,\" Tajani warned.\n\nThe Capri meeting of the top diplomats from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States dovetailed with other regional diplomatic efforts sending the same messages. On Wednesday, EU leaders meeting in Brussels vowed to ramp up sanctions on Iran to target its drone and missile deliveries to proxies in Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon.\n\nThe U.S. and Britain, meanwhile, announced Thursday they were imposing a new round of sanctions on Iran, with the U.S. targeting individuals and entities that produce engines that power drones and are involved in steel production. The latest British measures target several Iranian military organizations, individuals and entities involved in Iran\u2019s drone and ballistic missile industries.\n\nBorrell said the existing EU sanctions regime would be strengthened and expanded to punish Tehran and help prevent future attacks on Israel. At the same time, he said, Israel needed to exercise restraint.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to exaggerate but we are on the edge of a war, a regional war in the Middle East, which will be sending shockwaves to the rest of the world, and in particular to Europe,\" he warned. \"So stop it.\"\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Iran must be isolated \"because,of course, there must be a reaction to this unprecedented incident, but there must be no further escalation in the region,\" German news agency dpa reported.\n\nOn Ukraine, its Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who was invited to Capri as a guest, underlined his country\u2019s need for essential military support, including artillery, ammunition, and air defense systems as Russia pushes along the front line.\n\nHe thanked Germany for providing Ukraine with a new Patriot battery, which was announced over the weekend, but urged the U.S. Congress to quickly approve the funding package.\n\n\"So we will work here at the ministerial level to make other allies deliver air defense systems to Ukraine. Because it\u2019s of fundamental importance,\" Kuleba said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday he supported a proposal from the House speaker, Mike Johnson, to provide about $61 billion in aid for Ukraine, signaling bipartisan support for the precarious funding bill.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he hoped the U.S. funding would come through but said other allies needed to step up.\n\n\"In this moment, it is urgent that all of the friends and supporters of Ukraine maximize their efforts to provide Ukraine with what it needs to continue to effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression,\" Blinken said after meeting with Kuleba.\n\n\"If Putin is allowed to proceed with impunity, we know he won\u2019t stop at Ukraine and we can safely predict that his aggression will continue,\" Blinken said. \"Other would-be aggressors around the world will take note and unleash their own aggressions. And we will have a world of conflict, not a world of peace and security.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBorrell said Europe can't rely solely on Washington to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\n\"Concrete decisions have to be taken in order to send to Ukraine more air defense,\" he said. \"We do have Patriots, we have anti-missile systems. We have to take them from the our barracks where they are just in case, and to send to Ukraine where the war is raging. And I\u2019m sure we will be doing that, but it has to be done quickly.\"",

        "content": "Less than a week after the start of Russia\u2019s February 2022 full-scale of invasion of Ukraine peace talks began as, even then, it was clear that Putin\u2019s boast to be \u201cin Kyiv in three days\u201d wasn\u2019t going to happen. There then began several rounds of intense negotiation between Moscow, Kyiv, and several others that could have stopped the war virtually before it had begun.\n\nThe US international relations journal and think tank, Foreign Affairs, has acquired copies of the various draft versions of a peace treaty. They show how the discussions progressed and how the text of the treaties changed until eventually they reached a point where insurmountable differences stopped the process.\n\nThe negotiating processes.\n\nThe first round of talks, which lasted more than five hours, was facilitated by President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and was held in the Gomel region of Belarus on Feb. 28. Three days later they met again in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, also in Belarus. These talks resulted in an agreement to establish humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the third round of talks on March 7, in the Brest region, also in Belarus the two sides laid out their \u201cred lines\u201d for peace, at which point it was becoming obvious that there was unlikely to be a meeting of minds on the subject.\n\nAccording to the New York Times Kyiv demanded that Russians be held accountable for war crimes, its forces needed to withdraw from all occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and agree to pay financial reparations.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Who Is Andrey Belousov, Russia\u2019s New Defense Minister? Russia\u2019s defense ministry is now under the command of a career bureaucrat and economist with no military background \u2013 but for Putin, he might be the right man for the job.\n\nIn its turn Moscow insisted that Ukraine should recognize its 2014 annexation of Crimea, declare its permanent neutrality, and agree to autonomy for the ethnic Russian areas of eastern and southeastern Ukraine.\n\nDespite the lack of progress both sides agreed to continue talking and to include representatives of their presidential administrations, foreign and defense ministries in the future. Kyiv did signal that it was willing to consider Russia\u2019s demand for military neutrality if, in turn, Moscow accepted Kyiv\u2019s future membership in the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 10 Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmitry Kuleba, met on the sidelines of a diplomatic forum in Antalya, Turkey for a one-and-a-half-hour meeting chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. The main agenda item was to agree on a temporary cease-fire in Mariupol and other areas of intense fighting, to allow civilian evacuation.\n\nAgain, there was no progress primarily, according to Kuleba, because \u201cunfortunately, Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit to anything\u201d without the agreement of Putin. Russia said it was because Ukraine wanted to go back on issues agreed during the meetings in Belarus. Cavusoglu seemed to think there had been progress in his comments to Turkish media.\n\nFurther talks, held via video conferencing between March 13 and 17, seemed to offer real hope of a breakthrough. On March 15, President Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been \u201creal progress\u201d and Lavrov spoke of some hope for reaching a \u201ccompromise.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times said a 15-point draft deal had been prepared wherein Kyiv would give up its NATO ambitions in return for security guarantees outside NATO. Ukraine detected a softening of Russia\u2019s demands which Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak attributed to a reflection of how badly Putin\u2019s \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d invasion was going which left him with \u201cno chances whatsoever to move further into Ukraine territory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time of the sixth round of negotiations on March 21, the air of optimism was beginning to wane. Zelensky requested a face-to-face meeting with Putin which was rejected as it \u201cshould happen once the two sides are closer to agreeing on key issues.\u201d The resulting temporary halt to negotiations caused by this snub coincided with Ukraine\u2019s March 22 counteroffensive which by April 3 had ended the Russian threat to Kyiv.\n\nMarch 29, the seventh round of talks was held face-to-face in Istanbul during which a draft peace treaty began to take real shape. In return for permanent Ukrainian neutrality and non-nuclear status, it would receive security guarantees, described by some as \u201cNATO Article 5 Lite,\u201d underwritten by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Belarus (Russia\u2019s nomination) Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland and Turkey (Ukraine\u2019s choice).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Russia would agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, and Ukraine would reserve the right to take back the occupied Luhansk and Donetsk regions. It also clearly stated that all guarantors (including Russia), \u201cconfirm their intention to facilitate Ukraine\u2019s accession to the European Union.\u201d\n\nRussia also agreed to voluntarily reduce its military activity that threatened Kyiv to \u201ccreate the necessary conditions for further negotiations.\u201d The fact that Ukraine\u2019s week-old counteroffensive had already forced Russian forces a long way back from the capital suggested the Russian offer was hardly voluntary.\n\nPutin called the March 29 draft a \u201cnot bad result\u201d and indicated he was now prepared to meet Zelensky. The discussions ended with the expectation that the draft treaty laid down firm foundations for an end to the war and it was only the fine details that needed to be settled.\n\nAs the Ukrainians pushed Russian forces back from Kyiv revealing the atrocities committed by Moscow\u2019s troops in Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in the Kyiv region, negotiations continued.\n\nForeign Affairs quoted the then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who had been one of the mediators between Moscow and Kyiv, more than 15 drafts were prepared between March 29 and April 15, with this last version proposing to sign the final agreement by the end of the month.\n\nHow did success turn to failure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cnot-so-simple truth\u201d according to many including, significantly, Putin himself, was that Ukraine walked away from the deal because of pressure from the West and the poor performance of Russian forces led Kyiv to believe they would win the war.\n\nOthers said that the talks were just a sham with both sides merely going through the motions because that was what the international community expected. Russia\u2019s Putin-led views were too fundamental to accept anything other than victory, and each side was merely buying time to see how the war went.\n\nIt was suggested that although Ukraine said it was willing to renounce NATO membership, it did not trust the principle of third-party security guarantees because of the failure of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, by which Kyiv gave up its nuclear deterrent in return for security guarantees by among others the US and Russia, as well as the Minsk agreements which were supposed to have ended the post-2014 fighting in the Donbas.\n\nTo many it was obvious that there was no way Russia would ever voluntarily give up the annexed territories of Crimea and the Donbas. It was only the initial failure of the invasion that brought Moscow to the negotiating table while the success of Ukrainian forces not only persuaded Kyiv it could win but also gave impetus to Western allies to provide support to the \u201cwinning side.\u201d That combination also finally persuaded Kyiv that it no longer needed to make concessions \u2013 a view which further successes in the summer of 2022 only reinforced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Foreign Affairs publication quoted commentators who thought the whole basis of the negotiations was off beam. They say if the dialog had been truly meaningful it should have concentrated on conducting a cease-fire, de-escalation and protecting the civilian population. In fact, the whole basis of the discussions on both sides had been in trying to agree a post-war order when the outcome of the war was always in doubt. As the publication says: \u201cputting the cart of the post-war order before the horse of the end of the war.\u201d\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nThere has been little change in the views of either side, both seeing the only way forward being a military victory over the other. Many believe that, with the military situation becoming effectively deadlocked, the time is ripe to renew peace talks. There have been reports of \u201csecret talks\u201d between US and Russian officials and publicly voiced peace initiatives by Ukraine itself as well as China, the Vatican, Brazil, Mexico and others. The consensus is that after more than two years the war is going nowhere and, eventually, someone will lose patience and nuclear escalation will be the probable outcome.\n\nThe bottom line is surely that every war eventually ends in negotiation and compromise. The April 15 draft or something very similar seems as good a starting point as anything suggested so far. The big question is just how much is either side prepared to give and reduce its demands on the other to end this ultimately pointless war.\n\nWill Ukraine cede some of the territory it has already lost, and will Russia be prepared to give some back?\n\nWill Ukraine give up its desire for NATO membership or will Russia accept that joining the alliance is not the existential threat its public pronouncements suggest?\n\nWill both Ukraine and Russia truly believe that the external security guarantees Kyiv has signed with the G7 nations and others are worth the paper they are written on?\n\nWill peace lead to Russia re-entering the international community and the ending of economic and political sanctions or will Kyiv and others insist on some form of wide-ranging punishment including reparations for Ukraine being exacted on the Kremlin?",

        "content": "It is interesting that the ECB and EU seem to be closing ranks around Euroclear on the debate around using immobilized Russian assets for Ukraine. The Belgian depository is being ring fenced now as \u201csystemic - with the argument going that we cannot go after Russian assets there as it might risk a run on the euro or legal action by Moscow which could risk the stability of the Belgian based depository.\n\nBoth arguments appear more like scaremongering (bollox actually - excuse my French or Flemish) and indeed if Euroclear was so systemically important then it could be indemnified against any future lawsuits by Moscow by the EU. I would argue that the defeat of Ukraine by Russia, which would send Red Army tanks West again, is a much bigger and more likely systemic risk to Europe, and the euro, if we don\u2019t secure Ukraine\u2019s war time financing with the use of immobilized Russian assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs yet the IMF\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up and I just doubt the long-term commitment by Western taxpayers to spend $100 billion a year to keep Ukraine in the war - actually we are already failing here as reflected in ammo shortages now on the front line. The only assured source of long-term financing is from immobilized Russian assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the IMF is asking private creditors - pensioners - to stump up a $14.8 billion financing contribution to Ukraine via a new debt treatment. All well and good (creditors have already halted debt service payments to August 2024 and in a worst case scenario likely will extend that service halt to run in parallel to the Paris Club service suspension to 2027 - which will get close to the $14.8 billion financing contribution anyway) but how about first/also getting Belgium to stump up the EUR6-7 billion in interest earned on immobilized Russian assets.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Scholz Urges More Ukrainian Refugees in Germany to Take Up Work Germany is the EU country that has taken in the most Ukrainian refugees, about a third of the total. However, only about 18% were employed in January 2024, one of the lowest rates in the OECD.\n\nAs yet, the EU is only talking about utilizing the interest earned on these assets from 2024. Why? It is beyond me why Belgium gets to profiteer from the war by keeping the earnings from 2022-23. And how about Euroclear contributing the profits made on its business managing Russian central bank reserves way back in time when it was already clear that Russia was a fascist state acting in a malign manner against the West. How far back?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps 2008 and the invasion of Georgia, the poisoning of Litvinenko or Skrypal, or 2014 and the annexation of Crimea, and the first Russian invasion of Donbas - does Euroclear do ESG? I wonder.\n\nThe IMF talks about burden sharing, but at the moment I only see Western taxpayers and creditors (pensioners paying) doing this so how about Russian taxpayers, Belgium, and Euroclear helping share the burden a bit?\n\nReprinted from the author\u2019s @tashecon blog!

The Soviet Union\u2019s role was limited to fighting only against Germany and only along Germany\u2019s eastern Front. Although much of the fiercest fighting and casualties were on that Front, the Germans could not risk diverting more than 20% of their military manpower from other theaters of the war. Furthermore, the Soviet Union benefited greatly from the approximately $200 billion (in current U.S. dollars) of American \u201cLend Lease\u201d and supplies from England and the other allies.

        "content": "The value of an effective air defence system and of unwavering international support was crystal clear the night of Iran\u2019s massive attack on Israel: most Iranian missiles and drones were destroyed before they reached Israeli soil. The US, the UK and France, as well as Jordan, participated in Israel\u2019s defence.\n\nI arrived in Kyiv the following day. The contrast between the two emergencies could not be starker. Unlike Israel, Ukraine lacks sufficient air defences, and the west provides far less than it could or should to defend Ukraine against Russia. Ukraine is not dealing with one-off retaliation for striking a Russian consulate \u2013 as Israel is with Iran. Russia has been waging a war of aggression against Ukraine since 2014, aimed at eradicating its nationhood.\n\nDaily, Russian missiles and drones pummel Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure. A recent missile attack on a power generation plant in the north means that hundreds of thousands, if not a million more Ukrainians could be forced to leave their homes by next winter. Unable to occupy what is an unoccupiable country, Russia has decided it wants to make Ukrainian cities uninhabitable. Already the numbers are horrifying: before Russia\u2019s full-scale land invasion in 2022, Ukraine had a population of around 40 million. Today, just over 20 million live in free Ukraine, and that number could decline further in the months ahead.\n\nRussia is also making headway along the frontline, outmatching Ukraine in terms of artillery and manpower by a staggering 7:1 ratio, if not more. Now that the US House of Representatives has finally passed a long-awaited package of military aid worth $61bn for Ukraine after months of stalling, it could hold the line, perhaps losing some more territory in the Donetsk region. Final sign-off for the bill by Joe Biden is expected within days. In the worst case scenario, 2024 could see the fall of other major cities and towns such as Kharkiv, Sumy or Zaporizhzhia.\n\nMaking a state and a society function with a halved population, while fending off an invasion by one of the world\u2019s largest armies, requires unimaginable resilience. From what I could see over the course of a few days in the capital, Kyiv bustles with life. But it is life punctuated by almost daily air-raid sirens.\n\nAlong with a group from the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations I was on the way to the train station one day when our app alerts went off. There was no bunker for us to take refuge in, but our taxi driver shrugged, unflustered. There was no point in panicking, he said, we would reach the station soon and perhaps it would be over by then anyway. He was right; no sooner had we reached the station than Luke Skywalker\u2019s voice on our app thundered: \u201cThe air alert is over, may the Force be with you.\u201d\n\nFor Ukrainians to keep believing the Force is with them is hard enough. Doing so with one hand tied behind their back because of insufficient western support is next to impossible.\n\nIn some respects, the west is facing objective difficulty. It took Europe and the US almost two years to wake up to the fact that this would be a long war and that delivering part of their old weapon stocks would be insufficient. For two years (and more), Russia has put its economy on a war footing, while acquiring weapons from North Korea and Iran. The discrepancy in the ratios of artillery and ammunition are a reflection of this. Belatedly, the realisation of a long war has dawned on the west, and arms production is being ramped up: by next year, European governments should be able to compensate for some of the current mismatch. This is why Ukrainians perceive the coming months as their greatest window of vulnerability, perhaps greater than the first dramatic weeks after 24 February 2022.\n\nBut in other respects, European countries (and the US) have no excuses. Paradoxically, while lacking enough basic artillery and ammunition, Europe has no shortage of sophisticated air defence systems. There are approximately 100 such systems across Europe collecting dust. Important as the defence goal of deterring some future Russian aggression may be, the European continent is already at war. If European air defence systems continue lying around rather than being provided to Kyiv to save lives in Ukraine, they may end up being needed where they are currently stationed, turning the reasons against their transfer to Ukraine into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nUkraine doesn\u2019t need 100 Patriot and SAMP/T air defence systems; it just needs seven. But so far, with the exception of Germany, European countries have balked. They have come up with all sorts of reasons (or excuses), including the need to respect Nato standards. Yet many don\u2019t seem to have the same concern for breaking Nato standards on the target of 2% defence spending. If Germany can agree to send an additional Patriot battery to Ukraine despite having resisted vigorously, other European countries can follow suit. Not doing so now is simply unpardonable.\n\nIt is worth asking ourselves what explains this western reticence on Ukraine, especially given the stark contrast with the Middle East. There are two possible answers, neither of which is edifying. The first and bluntest is fear. The west has been pulling its punches in the Russia-Ukraine war because it is scared of Russia and Russian escalation. The more it has manifested its fear, the more it has galvanised Russia. Vladimir Putin smells fear, and like any fighter in a ring he is seizing the opportunity to double down. The Ukraine war has become existential for the Russian regime, and Ukraine\u2019s window of vulnerability may not last for ever. Therefore, best dig the knife in as deep as possible now that the west has immobilised itself in fear.\n\nThe second and most tragic reason is that Europe does not yet regard Ukraine as part of itself. As a colleague in Kyiv put it: \u201cEurope still considers us its \u2018good other\u2019.\u201d So long as that othering persists, Ukraine\u2019s existence will be in danger, and with it the security of the entire European continent. Showing that Ukraine is part of \u201cus\u201d means sending more of \u201cour\u201d air defences to protect Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. And it means approving Ukraine\u2019s EU accession negotiations framework and holding the first intergovernmental conference opening Ukraine\u2019s accession talks in June.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But insofar as it signals that Europeans actually treat Ukraine as part of Europe, it is existential. A diplomat stationed in Kyiv told us that when the EU moved to open accession negotiations with Ukraine last December, soldiers on the frontline were jubilant. Strange as it may seem, to them it was not an abstract idea but a tangible signal of belonging, of feeling they were not alone. And in this hour of greatest need, Ukraine needs missiles and munitions as much as a heavy injection of morale. It\u2019s hard not to return from Kyiv at the moment enriched, but with a heavy heart.\n\nNathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "content": "Great news that Speaker Johnson finally found his balls and did the right thing by putting the Ukraine support bill to the House - which duly backed it with a large majority. Notable also that included in the bill on TikTok was language that suggested that Congress supports the confiscation of the $300bn plus in immobilised Russian assets in Western jurisdiction. The House noted the fact that as Russia is the aggressor that this provides enough legal basis for confiscation. I strongly concur - let\u2019s see if the beancounters at the ECB actually manage to understand the national security imperative here.\n\nThe assumption now is the Senate votes on this this week allowing Biden to vote the Ukraine bill into law by the weekend and funds/munitions to flow by next week - long overdue - six months at least. The assumption is the U.S. has been prepositioning munitions close to theatre so that Ukrainian forces will be re-supplied in a matter of weeks now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe $61 billion was originally meant to take Ukraine thru to US elections. With the six month delay in getting this bill over the line one might think this could give Ukraine a little more time, or runway. However, given the risks still of a Trump presidency I doubt the Biden administration will risk this - disbursements on the $61 billion will surely be front loaded. That means Ukraine is going now to see a surge in military and financial support over the next six months. Doubts though still remain about long term funding beyond the U.S. election given Trump\u2019s less than certain position.\n\nAs others have argued, this funding hopefully comes just in the nick of time helping Ukraine shore up its defences which have been creaking of late as Ukraine was suffering a huge numerical disadvantage in munitions, as much as 1-10. The risk was that the Ukrainian frontline could have collapsed in places allowing Russia to take large additional swathes of Ukrainian territory. There is less chance of this now following the vote in the House. Less chance hopefully also of Ukraine being rocked by a much anticipated Russian counteroffensive north - perhaps another push to take Kyiv. Unless Putin brings forward his plans therein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine should now be able to shore up its defences and it has a chance of holding territory as is.\n\nOffensive operations likely should focus on making the continued occupation uncomfortable for Russia - rather than a large scale Ukrainian ground assault as was tried last summer. This should entail continued longer range missile strikes on Crimea, Russian naval operations in Black Sea, re-supply routes into Ukraine and attacks on infrastructure in Russia itself (oil refineries et al). The ambition here should be to make occupation so debilitating for Russia that Putin is forced to sue for peace.\n\nMuch here will depend on the munitions mix given now by the U.S. - let\u2019s hope longer range missiles are in the mix. Hopes of F16s being available at some point this year will also give Ukraine more options. And hopefully more air defences will help Ukraine protect its troops in the field and its cities and critical infrastructure - perhaps too late for much of its power generation capacity which was lost in recent weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. is sensitive about Ukrainian longer range missile attacks into Russia, particularly on energy infrastructure, given impacts on global oil prices and hence U.S. elections. These have proven highly effective in recent months and Ukraine will likely continue using arms manufactured domestically against targets in Russia. Again this has to be all about bringing the war to Russia and forcing Russia to sue for a peace acceptable to Ukraine.\n\nCrimea & the Black Sea appear to be the weak underbelly for Russia. Remember here that Putin annexed Crimea back in April 2014 for fear that post Euromaydan the peninsula would fall into NATO control - and the loss of Crimea as a strategic military asset for Ukraine. The loss of Crimea as a naval base was also seen as critical to Russian dominance in the Black Sea. And all the talk about the strategic necessity of Russia securing a land corridor to Crimea - which it took after the full scale invasion - underscores the strategic importance of Crimea to Russian military thinking. But longer range missile attacks by Ukraine have now made Crimea insecure - a huge loss to Russia compared to its position even back to before the annexation of Crimea. Having lost numerous naval assets in Crimea (likely another ship damaged over the weekend) Russia has had to deploy much of its actual Black Sea Fleet east. This represents a huge military, psychological and strategic defeat for Moscow. Further attacks on Crimea will reinforce the fact that the peninsula is no longer an asset but a huge liability to Russia - costing billions to sustain now for limited military advantage. Making Crimea and the Black Sea insecure for Russia will give Ukraine significant leverage in any future peace talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow will all this change Putin\u2019s narrative?\n\nLong wars inevitably ebb and flow. And the current Russo-Ukraine war seems no different.\n\nThis war initially saw assumptions of a speedy Russian defeat turn on Ukraine\u2019s valiant defence. We then saw successful Ukrainian counter strikes to retake territory on Kharkhiv and Kherson build optimism around a larger Ukrainian counteroffensive last summer. That failed which then saw Russia take back the initiative with gains in Bakhmut and Avdivka and elsewhere at the turn of the year.\n\nAnd much has been written in recent months of momentum in the war shifting to Russia as U.S. support withered, talk of Ukrainian military collapse and suggesting then that Russia could just wait all this out until the Trump presidency eventually threw in the towel. The line was that Ukrainian forces might collapse this year but even if they survived it was hard to see them enduring thru a Trump presidency when all U.S. support would be cut off - with Europe unable to then shoulder the additional burden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoscow seems to have believed this script - and there is much to suggest it was also not expecting the latest $61 billion to get thru Congress.\n\nHopes in Moscow of an early victory again in Ukraine have surely been dashed now, again. But the way that the House vote got over the line - Western politicians (Cameron, Duda et al) kissing the ring in Maro Lago - and then Trump\u2019s last minute suggestion that even he understood the importance of supporting Ukraine, will surely worry Moscow that Trump cannot actually be trusted to pull the plug on support for Ukraine. Moscow will now surely read the bipartisan support shown for the Ukraine bill as making it difficult to bet on a Trump presidency throwing in the towel on Ukraine. And the new $61 billion U.S. funding bill combined with Europe also appearing to finally get its act together on funding the war and its defence will surely worry Moscow that the forces being ranged now against it are appearing much more formidable.\n\nFor Moscow peace talks now might appear more logical - while it still has some advantage on the ground (if not sea), before U.S./NATO funding steps up, F16s appear, as its situation in Crimea further deteriorates and it suffers further losses in Russia itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine is still nervous over prospects of getting involved in any peace talks with Moscow as the fear is that Russia will just use any such peace to resupply for the next war. Fair points but if the West can provide enough reassurance that Ukraine\u2019s defence will remain a priority and sufficiently funded then Ukraine might just consider peace talks - the end game could be a Korean Peninsula style scenario. Many though still view the only long term solution or sustainable peace is for Russia to suffer a defeat in this war (see Timothy Synder here) - question is whether Moscow is forced to accept peace terms now whether this is a sufficient enough defeat.\n\nA question here is whether the $61 billion is a game changer in terms of Ukraine\u2019s financing outlook. It certainly helps short term - to year end 24\u2019. But again questions remain as to whether Trump will sustain US support for Ukraine. He seems to have given the nod to Johnson for the $61 billion package but given Trump\u2019s character it is hard to extrapolate that to suggest US financing is assured beyond January 2025. Given that it remains critical that the G7 signs off on the freezing and then allocation to Ukraine of the $330 billion in immobilised Russian assets in Western jurisdictions there to Ukraine. Therein the House statement was positive but still wishy washy - kind of falling back on the line that the G7 have to be in agreement for this to go ahead and deference there to the fact that most of the assets are in EU jurisdictions. Needs must though and as is, the West is still unclear how it is going to provide Ukraine\u2019s $100 billion annual financing need in war, and $50 billion plus in peace and reconstruction and recovery.\n\nReprinted from the author\u2019s @tashecon blog!

It is unclear how much this will cost, but will come from existing MoD budgets.\n\nThe package includes 60 boats with offshore raiding craft and dive boats; more than 1,600 strike and air defence missiles; more than 400 vehicles, including 160 protected mobility \u201cHusky\u201d vehicles and 162 armoured vehicles; as well as nearly 4m rounds of small arms ammunition.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines UK Free newsletter Get the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The final vote was 79 to 18.\n\nIn a call on Monday, Biden informed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that he would \u201cmove quickly\u201d to send desperately needed military aid, including air defence weaponry, after the bill\u2019s passage by the Senate.\n\nThe legislation includes $60.8bn to replenish Ukraine\u2019s war chest as it seeks to repel Russia from its territory; $26.3bn for Israel and humanitarian relief for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8.1bn for the Indo-Pacific region to bolster its defences against China.\n\nRussian missiles attacked a residential district of Kharkiv early on Wednesday, said the mayor, Ihor Terekhov.

In particular, analysts pointed out that Russian state media and milbloggers attempted to justify the strike by claiming that Ukrainian forces installed unspecified air defense communication and coordination equipment on the tower. They insinuated that Russian forces had tried and failed to down the Kharkiv City TV tower and other TV towers in Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts several times, including in March 2022. Russian forces notably struck a TV tower in Kyiv City on March 1, 2022, shortly after Russian forces launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin may intend to invoke the memory of the March 2022 Kyiv City strike and the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to create panic among Ukrainians during another challenging moment of the war.\n\nAnalysts also cite warnings from Ukrainian media that Russian forces are seizing on concern about a possible Russian offensive operation against Kharkiv City to sow panic and a feeling of \"impending, inevitable catastrophe\" in Ukraine.\n\n\"Kremlin mouthpieces are seizing on concerns about a future Russian offensive operation against Kharkiv City to conduct a likely coordinated information operation in an effort to create outsized panic among Ukrainians. ISW assesses that the likelihood of a successful Russian ground offensive against Kharkiv is very low if Ukraine receives renewed U.S. military aid rapidly,\" the report said.\n\nISW previously assessed that a Russian offensive operation aimed at seizing Kharkiv City would be an extremely ambitious undertaking that would pose significant challenges to Russian forces and that the Russian military command will likely have to reconsider its objectives for its forecasted summer 2024 offensive effort to account for better equipped and manned Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"The Russian military command may attempt to destroy Kharkiv City with air, missile, and drone strikes and prompt a large-scale internal displacement of Ukrainian civilians if the Russian military determines that it cannot successfully seize the city with ground operations. Continued timely U.S. and Western military assistance, particularly the provision of air defense systems and missiles, will be critical to Ukraine's defense of Kharkiv City,\" ISW analysts said.\n\nThe institute recalled a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov from April 19 that Kharkiv City \"plays an important role\" in Russian President Vladimir Putin's idea of establishing a demilitarized \"sanitary zone\" in Ukraine to supposedly protect Russian border settlements from Ukrainian strikes.",

The United States, having launched a sweeping attack on all undesirable countries simultaneously (you know this axis of \u201cevil\u201d: from Belarus to North Korea, including Russia, China, Iran and others), they realized that they made a mistake as they brought together the disobedient Russia and their main enemy China.

They realized that they could not handle this union,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko said.The president said that he is keeping tabs on these issues, since he had to discuss them with senior American officials five years ago.But the United States found a way out: they instigated a conflict in Europe, in Ukraine, and put it on the shoulders of the European Union and NATO, promising to help with money.\u201cThe goal is to distract, get Russia bogged down in the war with Ukraine, weaken it with the war and sanctions (as Russia will be too busy to build an alliance with China). And meanwhile, they wanted to deal with China, and drag others whenever possible into this showdown: AUKUS [defense alliance of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States], which is a new NATO in the Pacific, and then Japan and South Korea.

This is true,\" the president said. \u201cBut have Washington and London become stronger in terms of political reputation and authority in the international arena over the years? No. On the contrary, we see how the global standing of the once truly influential powers is collapsing. An economic collapse is not far off. Experts are already talking about the precariousness of the global dollar pyramid.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Aleksandr Lukashenko recalled the conflicts unleashed after World War II. According to him, the carpet bombing of Dresden and atomic bombing of Japan were then echoed in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, Nicaragua, Panama, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and Syria. \"All these pursued new geopolitical goals, namely redistribution of the markets for oil, gas, rare metals and other minerals. People were killed for them,\" the Belarusian leader said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited the example of Libya, once the richest country. In 2010, before the aggression, Libya's GDP was estimated at more than $75 billion. Now the country has slipped into fragmentation and a resource-based economy.\n\nIn Syria, more than 300,000 people have died in 10 years of civil war unleashed to change the political regime.\n\n\n\n\n\nIS was revived on Afghan territory. \"We know whose project it is. It spreads violence and death far beyond its camps. It is known for whose money and with whose weapons they fight,\" the Belarusian head of state said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWars for money have never made anyone stronger, the president stressed. The creditors of the wars enriched themselves either by selling weapons or by driving countries into debt, as is the case with the fraternal Ukraine today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whom did the massacre between Israel and Palestine benefit? Syria and Lebanon got dragged in the Middle East war. And look how delicately and subtly they are playing to pit Israel and Iran against each other. Practically the nuclear powers. This, of course, is far from us. But it is far away only geographically. From the point of view of Belarus' interests, including economic ones, it is very close. They are trying to take the hotbed of tension to the south in order to finally destroy the Eurasian market, cultural and friendly ties,\" the Belarusian leader said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAleksandr Lukashenko explained that this is done by the weakening hegemon: \"Global hegemony is their best asset. They don't have to do anything. They turn on a machine and print dollars. And stay rich.\"",

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nRussia on Wednesday vetoed a United Nations resolution that proposed a ban on the use of nuclear weapons in outer space amid US intelligence-backed concerns that Moscow is trying to develop a nuclear device capable of destroying satellites.\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the UN draft as a \u201cdirty spectacle\u201d and a \u201ccynical ploy\u201d prepared by the resolution\u2019s backers, the US and Japan.\n\nIn February, President Joe Biden confirmed the US has intelligence that Russia is developing a nuclear anti-satellite capability. Three sources familiar with the intelligence subsequently told CNN the weapon could destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated.\n\nBefore the vote, senior US officials claimed Russia might be hiding something should it veto the text.\n\nUS Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield echoed those claims in her speech after the vote on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAnd so today\u2019s veto begs the question: Why? Why, if you are following the rules, would you not support a resolution that reaffirms them?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhat could you possibly be hiding? It\u2019s baffling. And it\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nThe US ambassador also condemned China\u2019s abstention, saying Beijing \u201chas shown that it would rather defend Russia as its junior partner, than safeguard the global nonproliferation regime.\u201d\n\nThe Council voted against resolution amendments tabled by Russia and China.\n\nThomas-Greenfield said Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cmarks a real missed opportunity to rebuild much-needed trust in existing arms control obligations.\u201d\n\nA US and Japan-drafted resolution had received cross-regional support from more than 60 member states.\n\nIt intended to strengthen and uphold the global non-proliferation regime, including in outer space, and reaffirm the shared goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes.\n\nIt also called on UN member states not to develop nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction designed to be placed in Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nNuclear threat\n\nThe potential threat of nuclear weapons in space has been amplified by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has triggered Europe\u2019s most significant land conflict since World War II and sent relations between the US and Russia \u2013 the world\u2019s two largest nuclear armed states \u2013 to new lows.\n\nThe White House\u2019s comments on the prospect of a Russian nuclear space weapon have deepened those concerns.\n\nExperts say this kind of weapon could have the potential to wipe out mega constellations of small satellites, like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which has been successfully used by Ukraine to counter Russian troops.\n\nThis would almost certainly be \u201ca last-ditch weapon\u201d for Russia, the US official and other sources said \u2014 because it would do the same damage to whatever Russian satellites were also in the area.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said in March that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to the existence of the Russian state but \u201cthere has never been such a need.\u201d\n\nHe also told officials that space projects, including the setup of a nuclear power unit in space, should be a priority and receive proper financing.\n\nLast year, Putin deployed tactical nuclear weapons to neighboring ally Belarus, and former Russian president and deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said strategic nuclear weapons could be used to defend territories incorporated into Russia from Ukraine.",

In Moldova, wedged between an embattled Ukraine and Romania, Russia\u2019s interference is only increasing. And without more Western help, its foreign minister told me this week, this small European country could fall under Moscow\u2019s control.\n\nMihai Popsoi, Moldova\u2019s 37-year-old newly minted top diplomat, was in Washington to remind Biden administration officials and lawmakers that the war in Ukraine is not just about Ukraine. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor two years ago, the 3 million residents of Moldova have faced unprecedented instability and anxiety. Putin is threatening Moldova\u2019s security, squeezing its economy and undermining its democracy, efforts that are all aimed at replacing its pro-Western leadership with a new government bought and paid for by the Kremlin.\n\nKamyanets-Podilskyi Uman UKRAINE Briceni Soroca TRANSNISTRIA Self-proclaimed republic since 1991 Botosani Balti Ribnita Dnister River MOLDOVA Dubasari Iasi Chisinau Tiraspol Bender Vaslui Bacau ROMANIA Odessa Comrat UKRAINE Mouth of Dnister River Cahul Focsani Bolhrad Galati Black Sea Izmayil Braila Buzau Tulcea Danube River Danube Delta 25 MILES Kamyanets-Podilskyi Uman UKRAINE Briceni Soroca TRANSNISTRIA Balti Ribnita Self-proclaimed republic since 1991 MOLDOVA Dubasari Iasi Chisinau Tiraspol ROMANIA Bender Bacau Odessa Comrat Dnister R.

Comrat UKRAINE Black Sea Galati Danube River Danube Delta 50 MILES\n\nWhile Moldova, under European Union-aligned President Maia Sandu, struggles to fight off Russian meddling and build ties with the West, it knows that its survival as a democracy is contingent on Ukraine\u2019s survival, the foreign minister told me. The only thing standing between Moldova (which has fewer than 10,000 personnel in its armed forces) and a Russian attack is the Ukrainian army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue of whether Russia wants to invade, it\u2019s only an issue of if they can,\u201d Popsoi said. \u201cGod forbid, if the Russians would feel emboldened, clearly Moldova would be next. And after that, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nFor now, Russia is waging hybrid warfare in Moldova, whereby the Kremlin is using all available means of leverage and interference to impose its will \u2014 short of bombing the country. Moscow has tried to orchestrate a coup, trained fake anti-government protesters, flooded the country with disinformation and funneled illicit cash to pro-Russian opposition parties.\n\nJust last weekend, Moscow hosted a conference for pro-Russian Moldovan opposition leaders, who announced a new election bloc ahead of Moldova\u2019s October presidential elections. The main pro-Russian party is led by Israeli-born Moldovan billionaire Ilan Shor, who was convicted in 2017 of stealing $1 billion from banks in his country. In 2022, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Shor for working with \u201ccorrupt oligarchs and Moscow-based entities to create political unrest in Moldova\u201d and undermine Moldova\u2019s moves to join the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoldovans will also vote in October on whether to amend the country\u2019s constitution to enshrine its E.U. membership aspirations. This is what angers Putin most of all, Popsoi said. It\u2019s not lost on Moldovans that Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine was sparked by Kyiv\u2019s turn toward the E.U., and that Putin tries to justify his 2022 invasion by pointing to Ukraine\u2019s aspirations to join NATO.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are using our democratic process against us,\u201d Popsoi said. \u201cThey are trying to install a pro-Russian authoritarian regime that would mimic the Russian model of government, to stab Ukraine in the back.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Josh Rogin 's opinions Follow\n\nThe internationally recognized territory of Moldova includes two regions already with greater loyalty to Moscow. Russia has about 1,500 \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d troops in the autonomous region of Transnistria, a strip of land along Ukraine\u2019s western border, that it could activate as troublemakers at any time. And last year, Moscow scored a success in its political incursions into Moldova when its heavily supported candidate for governor of the autonomous region of Gagauzia won, despite being virtually unknown before her candidacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the Western-leaning Moldovan government has been moving to reduce dependence on Russian energy and to thwart Russian interference, with significant U.S. help. Largely because of U.S. and European investment, Moldova cut its dependence on Russian gas and is now buying U.S.-supplied liquefied natural gas (at lower prices, by the way) through a new cooperative project with Greece.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more the United States and its partners can and should do. President Biden should show solidarity by inviting Sandu to the White House. Moldova needs more foreign investment in its infrastructure so it can become a hub for the future reconstruction of Ukraine. It also needs help dealing with Russia\u2019s advances in technology, such as deepfakes and other tools powered by artificial intelligence, which are amplifying the Kremlin\u2019s disinformation campaigns.\n\n\u201cMoldova is a petri dish for Russian hybrid warfare,\u201d Popsoi said. \u201cAnd the tactics that we see being used in Moldova, if the Russians feel they are effective here, they are going to take them on the road.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a popular narrative in parts of the Republican Party that holds that Ukraine can\u2019t win its war with Russia, and that U.S. aid is only prolonging the conflict. This view, as espoused by Sen. J.D. Vance (Ohio) and others, ignores the impact Ukraine\u2019s defeat would have for its neighbors, the rest of the region \u2014 and the United States.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s ambitions are imperial; he doesn\u2019t deny them. He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union,\u201d the foreign minister said. If Russia isn\u2019t stopped in Ukraine, \u201cthen all democracies are in trouble.\u201d",

The US agreed to send 31 Abrams to Ukraine in January 2023. Five have been lost to Russian attacks. The proliferation of drones means \u201cthere isn\u2019t open ground that you can just drive across without fear of detection\u201d, a senior defence official said on Thursday. \u201cNow, there is a way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with our Ukrainian partners, and other partners on the ground, to help them think through how they might use that, in that kind of changed environment now, where everything is seen immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians have not adopted tactics that could have made the tanks more effective, one of the US defence officials said, such as in combined-arms warfare, training for which was provided by the US in Germany. Russian forces have sustained heavy losses of their own tanks and armoured equipment due to highly effective surveillance and attacks by Ukrainian drone warfare units.\n\nThe US does not expect Ukraine to launch large-scale offensive operations against Russian forces in the near term, a US defence official said. The goal was to help Ukraine\u2019s forces \u201cregain the initiative \u2026 In terms of what we see in the next several months of operations, Ukrainians will need to rebuild quite a bit to take on board all of these new supplies after having rationed ammunition and other supplies \u2026 and ensure that they can defend their positions\u201d.\n\nIntense artillery, rocket and drone attacks either side of the Russia-Ukraine frontline left at least 10 people dead and more than a dozen wounded, regional officials said. Russian attacks killed at least six in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian officials said. Four people were killed in Russian-occupied parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, according to Moscow-installed authorities.\n\nChina must stop supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine if it wants to enjoy good relations with the west, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in Berlin on Thursday. \u201cLast year, Russia imported 90% of its microelectronics from China, used to produce missiles, tanks and aircraft. China is also working to provide Russia with improved satellite capabilities and imaging,\u201d he said. \u201cChina says it wants good relations with the west \u2026 They cannot have it both ways.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg cautioned western allies: \u201cIn the past, we made the mistake of becoming dependent on Russian oil and gas. We must not repeat that mistake with China. Depending on its money, its raw materials, its technologies \u2013 dependencies make us vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Macron has warned that Europe faces an existential threat from Russian aggression and must adopt a \u201ccredible\u201d defence strategy less dependent on the US. The French president described Russia\u2019s behaviour after its invasion of Ukraine as \u201cuninhibited\u201d and said it was no longer clear where Moscow\u2019s \u201climits\u201d lay. In his almost two-hour-long speech, Macron warned that \u201cour Europe, today, is mortal and it can die\u201d, Jennifer Rankin writes from Brussels.\n\nPoland and Lithuania have said they are prepared to help Ukrainian authorities return men subject to military conscription, after Ukraine\u2019s government announced this week that it was suspending consular services and the issue of passports for such men who are living abroad, Shaun Walker writes from Warsaw. \u201cWe have suggested for a long time that we can help the Ukrainian side ensure that people subject to [compulsory] military service go to Ukraine,\u201d W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland\u2019s defence minister, told the television channel Polsat. His Lithuanian counterpart, Laurynas Kas\u010di\u016bnas, said his country may make similar efforts. \u201cUkraine is very short of mobilisation reserve \u2026 This is not fair to those citizens who are fighting for their country.\u201d\n\nThe Polish parliament is due to consider new regulations next week that would require all Ukrainians to show a valid passport to be able to access benefits in Poland. Previously, Ukrainian refugees had been able to do so by showing any other documents proving their identity. Kosiniak-Kamysz, the defence minister, said: \u201cI think many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine.\u201d Tadeusz Ko\u0142odziej, a Polish NGO lawyer, said: \u201cThe draft text we have seen would cut around 80% of benefits for people without passports \u2026 If it will be impossible to get a passport, many of these people may ask for asylum.\u201d",

However, it remains unclear how much pressure Kyiv can apply on Russia after months of rationing artillery due to low stocks.\n\nAdditionally, Kyiv faces manpower shortages on the battlefield and questions remain about the strength of its fortifications along the sprawling, 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.\n\nThe goal, according to the US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity with AFP, is to enable Ukraine so that its forces would be able to \u201cregain the initiative.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn terms of what we see in the next several months of operations, Ukrainians will need to rebuild quite a bit to take on board all of these new supplies after having rationed ammunition and other supplies \u2026 and ensure that they can defend their positions,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cSo I would not forecast any large-scale offensive in the near term,\u201d the official said, while expressing optimism that Kyiv would be able to start applying \u201csignificantly greater pressure\u201d on Russian forces including in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Ukraine FM Visits Serbia For First Time Since Russian Invasion Serbia remains a rare outlier in Europe for refusing to sanction the Kremlin following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has had the battlefield advantage since capturing the long-time bastion town of Avdiivka in the eastern Donbas region in February, and its forces have been slowly advancing using greater numbers of troops and artillery shells.\n\nUS officials have stressed the importance of new US aid for Ukraine, even if Ukraine might take time to rebuild momentum.\n\nBiden had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Despite initial objections from former President Donald Trump and some Republicans in Congress, the aid package was approved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to US aid, the European Union is providing assistance, including a Czech-led initiative that will begin supplying Ukraine with some 300,000 rounds of 155mm artillery shells in June. Germany also announced plans in April to supply a US-made Patriot air defense system and air defense missiles.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe $95 billion military aid package President Joe Biden signed Wednesday was a feat of tough-minded negotiation to get funding to Ukraine and Israel after months of congressional horse-trading. But if the aid inflates those countries\u2019 war aims, it could discourage the kind of tough-minded negotiation that is the only way to end their wars.\n\nMark Hannah Courtesy of Mark Hannah\n\nBiden is right to help democratic countries confront their illiberal enemies. Israel and Ukraine suffered terrible crimes of aggression. But lofty expressions of unconditional support can paradoxically hurt the countries they are meant to help by hindering the kind of negotiated peace that saves civilian lives and restores stability.\n\nThe funds might motivate Ukraine and Israel to pursue unwinnable victories: the full restoration of Ukraine\u2019s borders and reclamation of Crimea, and the destruction of Hamas, respectively. In international politics and armed conflict, fraught as they are with mutual distrust and competing views of fairness, sometimes countries can\u2019t achieve justice \u2014 they can only achieve peace.\n\nThe new infusion of aid gives the US a lot of leverage with Ukraine and Israel. Washington has largely refused to exercise its leverage thus far, but it must do so now or peace in the near future doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to maintain that \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas is the only outcome he will accept. But as the war grinds on, Israel reports having killed fewer than half of Hamas\u2019 fighters while its tunnel network hasn\u2019t been completely dismantled, indicating the group can likely sustain an insurgency against Israel for the foreseeable future. And even if it were possible to destroy Hamas, that outcome could prove to be a catastrophic success when images of the accompanying civilian devastation fuel ever more radicalization among Palestinians and stirs angry Arab publics who pressure their leaders to scuttle Arab-Israeli normalization efforts.\n\nSimilarly, the Ukrainian government insists it will continue fighting until it regains all of the territory it has lost, including Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and there is no sign the US administration is pushing it to reconsider. But as Gen. Mark Milley, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me a year ago, \u201cneither side is likely to achieve their complete political objectives through military means\u201d so \u201cit will probably end somewhere, somehow at a negotiating table.\u201d And that was before Ukraine lost some of its best troops and equipment in last summer\u2019s highly anticipated offensive, which failed to strike a knockout blow to Russia.\n\nTo its credit, the administration seems clear-eyed enough to privately acknowledge Ukraine\u2019s chances for retaking additional territory are slim. But there is still no public indication the US is trying to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement. Signaling American resolve can preserve Ukraine\u2019s bargaining position, but it risks convincing Ukraine to reject a reasonable peace deal \u2014 if one is eventually offered \u2014 and continue fighting in pursuit of morally righteous but unattainable goals.\n\nLikewise, while the administration has ramped up humanitarian aid to Gaza, encouraged negotiations to get Hamas to release Israeli hostages and called for the Palestinian Authority to administer Gaza, it could do more to convince Israel to fundamentally rethink its destabilizing goals. The Biden administration should publicly and privately convey to Israel\u2019s leaders that their current strategy is unlikely to succeed and undermines regional security.\n\nThere will be at least a few objections to orienting American policy toward the best possible outcomes in these conflicts \u2014 achieving peace and stability in the near term \u2014 rather than the unrealistic goals of our partners.\n\nWar has a way of eliciting worldviews organized around simplistic binaries. After the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, then-President George W. Bush declared that every country had to decide: \u201cEither you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\u201d When Biden spoke of the war in Ukraine, Americans were told we faced a choice between offering Kyiv unconditional support or \u201cwithdrawing\u201d from the conflict and letting Putin \u201cerase\u201d Ukraine. But these kinds of Manichean views that divide the world into evil aggressors and righteous victims do not make impossible military victories any more achievable.\n\nSome people will say that the US can\u2019t simply tell Ukraine and Israel, both sovereign countries, what to do. Indeed, this has largely been Biden\u2019s public position, evident in his mantra \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and in the State Department\u2019s insistence that \u201cthe United States doesn\u2019t dictate to Israel what it must do.\u201d\n\nThese countries do have agency \u2014 but so does the United States. American involvement in assisting these nations\u2019 war efforts gives it the right and responsibility to share the course of each conflict in ways that protect its interests. The US can respect Ukraine\u2019s and Israel\u2019s agency without subjugating its own.\n\nIn Ukraine, this doesn\u2019t mean threatening the withdrawal of aid, which would weaken its battlefield and negotiating position. Instead, the US could have enforced the restrictions it had already made (on Abrams Tanks, F-16s, cluster munitions and long-range missiles) or it could now materially support diplomatic efforts as enthusiastically as military efforts. However, the recent aid package includes long-range missiles, or ATACMS, which suggests Ukraine is readying an offensive against Crimea. For a year and a half, Biden judiciously refused to send these to Ukraine, calling them a \u201cred line\u201d for Putin, who might use nuclear weapons were Crimea attacked.\n\nIn Israel, putting conditions on military aid is a better idea. The US did use leverage after an Israeli military strike killed aid workers from World Central Kitchen \u2014 with sources telling CNN that Biden warned Netanyahu that the US would reconsider how it\u2019s supporting Israel\u2019s war unless Israel allowed for more humanitarian aid in Gaza. After that, Israel acceded to the ultimatum and, per a reported demand by Biden, publicly announced the change that day. Unfortunately, there\u2019s little evidence the president has kept up the pressure. When the aid package passed Congress, a pro-Israel lobbying group cheered that the security assistance came \u201cwith no added conditions.\u201d\n\nOne historical example illustrates how the US might use its leverage with Netanyahu today. After Israel encircled the Egyptian military in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to Tel Aviv and pressured Prime Minister Golda Meir to enact a ceasefire. Egypt\u2019s attack was, like that of Hamas, an unprovoked and surprise act of aggression. Kissinger feared a victory by the Soviet-backed Arab states. But recently declassified documents show he also feared an all-out Israeli victory.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nKissinger wrote that \u201cfrom an Israeli point of view, it is no disaster to have the whole Arab world radicalized and anti-American, because this guarantees our continued support. From an American point of view, it is a disaster.\u201d Kissinger advised that the US needed \u201cto be taken even more seriously\u201d by Israel, and \u201cour insistence on a more politically oriented policy cannot go unheeded.\u201d This advice rings even truer today.\n\nFundamentally, negotiated settlements are often morally unsatisfying. Russia shouldn\u2019t be allowed to invade a sovereign country and get away with it. Israel has the right to defend itself.

It is important not to lose this value in these changes, which is European integration, which is our community activity, as well as our use of Europe's potential in this changing geopolitical architecture of the world- said Kwasniewski.\n\n- The Union will change and must change and must have a strong, rational voice of Poland - pro -European, not naive (...).We made the right decision at the right time.We were not late for the history of history, if we did not do it in 2004, we would not be in the EU to this day.We were smart on time - the politician concluded.",

Democratic President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law.\n\nAbout 12% of the uranium used to produce electricity at U.S. nuclear power plants is imported from Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council said Wednesday that Biden shares lawmakers\u2019 concerns about U.S. reliance on Russia for low-enriched uranium to support its domestic nuclear fleet.\n\nIncluded in the administration's announcement are importers of cotton cellulose and nitrocellulose, which are used to produce gunpowder, rocket propellants and other explosives. The penalties also target Russian government entities and people tied to Russia's chemical and biological weapons programs, companies related to Russia's natural gas construction projects and three workers at the penal colony where Navalny died.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has railed against earlier rounds of U.S. and Western penalties, claiming they are \"illegitimate sanctions\" on his country.\n\nA group of 16 targets in China and Hong Kong, most of which are related to Russian procurement workarounds, are named by the Biden administration.\n\nYellen traveled to Guangzhou and Beijing last month to warn Chinese officials that they \"must not provide material support for Russia\u2019s war and that they will face significant consequences if they do.\"\n\nChina has said it is not providing Russia with arms or military assistance, although Beijing has maintained robust economic connections with Moscow, alongside India and other countries, as the West imposes sanctions.\n\nCompanies in China, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were accused of helping Russia acquire technology and equipment from abroad. The penalties aim to block them from using the U.S. financial system and bar American citizens from dealing with them.\n\nBiden last week said he would immediately rush badly needed weaponry to Ukraine as he signed into law a $95 billion war aid measure that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots.\n\nThe upcoming uranium ban is also expected to impact Russian revenues by at least $1 billion.

Joe Manchin, a Democrat who heads that Senate committee, said it was \"unconscionable\" for the U.S. to help make it possible for Putin to \"finance his unlawful war against Ukraine\" through U.S. reliance on Russian uranium.\n\nBesides the import ban, the legislation frees up $2.7 billion in previously authorized funding to ramp up domestic uranium production.",

Some 193 states have ratified the convention.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.\n\nChloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to \"dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions\" - is an oily substance which was widely used during World War One. It causes irritation of the lungs, eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC).\n\nThe chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW.\n\nThe state department also said Moscow had regularly used \"riot control agents,\" or tear gas, during the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has previously warned Russia against deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine. In March 2022, weeks after Moscow launched its invasion, Mr Biden vowed that President Vladimir Putin would pay a \"severe price\" if he did authorise the use of chemical weapons.\n\n\"We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nBut there have been consistent reports that Moscow has ignored that warning. US Assistant Secretary for Arms Control Mallory Stewart has previously said Russia was using riot control agents in the conflict.\n\nAnd Ukraine says its troops have faced mounting chemical attacks in recent months. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this year that Russian forces had used grenades loaded with CS and CN tear gases.\n\nThe report added that at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic gases, and that one had died after suffocating on tear gas.\n\nThree Russian bodies linked to the country's biological and chemical weapons programme were sanctioned by the state department for their links to the production of chemical agents. Other firms that contributed to the government entities were also sanctioned.",

The remaining 37 lawmakers were absent.\n\nUS-SANCTIONED EX-INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WITH RUSSIAN TIES TO BE APPOINTED SERBIAN VICE-PREMIER\n\nThe government includes former intelligence chief Aleksandar Vulin, who has made several visits to Russia in recent months, as one of several vice-premiers, along with Nenad Popovi\u0107, another Russia supporter who has faced U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe foreign minister in the previous government, Ivica Da\u010di\u0107, also a pro-Russia politician, will be in charge of the Interior Ministry in the new Cabinet.\n\nThe vote followed a heated two-day debate. President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107's ruling nationalist conservative Serbian Progressive Party holds a comfortable majority after an election in December that fueled political tensions because of reports of widespread irregularities.\n\nThe increasingly authoritarian Vu\u010di\u0107 has refused to join Western sanctions against Moscow over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, though Serbia has condemned the aggression.\n\nVu\u010devi\u0107, the new prime minister, reiterated that Belgrade doesn't intend to impose sanctions on Russia and \"cannot and will not give up\" its friendship with Russia.

Vulin is also accused of involvement in a drug trafficking ring, according to U.S. authorities.\n\nVulin, who in the past had served as both the army and police chief, has recently received two medals of honor from Russia, one from the Federal Security Service, or FSB, and the other was awarded to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPopovi\u0107, a businessman and a former government minister, has \"used his Russia-based businesses to enrich himself and gain close connections with Kremlin senior leaders,\" the U.S. Treasury said last November in a statement.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Radomir Lazovic criticized the inclusion of the disputed ministers. Lazovic said \"these individuals shouldn\u2019t be part of the government, not just because they are blacklisted, but because their harmful behavior has hurt the citizens of Serbia.\"\n\nThe U.S. sanctions against individuals and companies in the Balkans are designed to counter attempts to undermine peace and stability in the volatile region and Russia's \"malign\" influence.\n\nThe West has stepped up efforts to lure the troubled region into its fold, fearing that Russia could stir unrest to avert attention from the war in Ukraine. The Balkans went through multiple wars in the 1990s, and tensions still persist.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSerbia's falling democracy record has pushed the country away from EU integration, explained Ejdus. Reports of election fraud at the Dec. 17 vote triggered street protests and clashes.\n\n\"Vu\u010di\u0107 is still pretending to be on the EU path because it\u2019s beneficial for Serbia\u2019s economy, and the EU tolerates his authoritarian tendencies out of fear of instability that could be caused in its backyard if Belgrade was lost to Russia and China,\" Ejdus said.",

With Moscow\u2019s troops scoring small advances around the frontline in recent weeks, it doesn\u2019t believe it has to negotiate.\n\nFor Sergey Radchenko, professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), a solution remains far off, despite the efforts: \u201cThe Russians are clearly still hoping to win this war outright, while Ukraine is hoping that they will rally Western support and outlast Russia in the long-term.\u201d\n\nHe is also sceptical of a summit going ahead without Russia.\n\n\u201cAn eventual ceasefire agreement/peace treaty would have to involve Russia: there is no way around it because a negotiation that does not involve a key party is more of a solidarity exercise than a true negotiation,\u201d Radchenko told Euractiv.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the June talks, Ukraine and its Western allies want to rally broader international support for Kyiv, campaigning to persuade as many non-Western countries as possible to attend.\n\nDiplomats involved in the preparations say there are fears the summit threatens to become a Western affair, without strong Global South participation.\n\nWhile previous rounds of preparatory meetings managed to attract more non-Western states, it might be more difficult to secure the same when it comes to higher-level participation from those countries, they worry.\n\nChina, which experts say is unlikely to renounce support for Russia, has warned it won\u2019t participate if Russia isn\u2019t represented.\n\nFurther conditions for China to participate include confirmation that it will not amount to a full-blown summit so that they could send an envoy instead of a high-ranking politician, as well as their and other peace blueprints to be considered, people with knowledge of the discussion said.\n\n\u201cI do not think that the purpose \u2013 rallying the Global South and/or China \u2013 will be served particularly well by [not inviting Russia], as we already have witnessed from earlier gatherings, like in Malta,\u201d Radchenko said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the perspective of Western diplomats, it is clear that if Beijing, Moscow\u2019s most important ally, does not take part, the summit can hardly be a success.\n\nThat being said, EU officials are increasingly sceptical about the role Beijing can play in any future peace process.\n\nWith Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s trip to Europe, they hope Beijing\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine will be a key topic and Europeans will be able to convince Beijing it is in its interest to play a greater role in ending the Ukraine war.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said he will ask Xi to commit to that goal when he visits Paris, which is preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer.\n\nIt is customary where peace is expected to be upheld during the Olympics, but the 2008 Games in Beijing did not halt Russia\u2019s August invasion of Georgia back then.\n\nAt the same time, Western officials fear the next few weeks might be marked by Russia making more tactical gains in eastern Ukraine, especially around the key June date.\n\nA changed reality on the ground could change the dynamics of the talks, with increased pressure about the need to kickstart actual peace talks, they worry.\n\n\u201cA conference that actually aims to achieve a breakthrough would have to entail a protracted negotiation between a very limited number of parties,\u201d Radchenko said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment what we are seeing is a tendency towards a short PR event with a large number of parties, except the ones that matter,\u201d he added.",

Russian officials consistently time nuclear readiness exercises and vague threats of nuclear retaliation with important Western policy decisions regarding the war in Ukraine to force Western decision-makers to self-deter and temper their support for Ukraine.\n\nThe current apparent resurgence of nuclear rhetoric, this time in the form of planned tactical nuclear weapons exercises, coincides with the imminent arrival of Western weapons in Ukraine, analysts said.\n\n\"Russian officials are likely using the nuclear weapons information operation to discourage Ukraine's Western partners from providing additional military support and to scare Western decision-makers out of allowing Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided systems to attack legitimate military targets in Russia,\" ISW said.\n\nRussian troops engage in routine nuclear exercises as part of this wider nuclear rhetoric information operation, but ISW continues to assess that Russia is highly unlikely to use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine or anywhere else.",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin began his fifth term as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office after destroying his political opponents, launching a devastating war in Ukraine and concentrating all power in his hands.\n\nAlready in office for nearly a quarter-century and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Mr Putin\u2019s new term does not expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.\n\nAt the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Mr Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.\n\n\u201cWe are a united and great people and together we will overcome all obstacles, realise all our plans, together we will win,\u201d Mr Putin said after being sworn in.\n\nHe used the the first moments of his fifth term to thank the \u201cheroes\u201d of his war in Ukraine and to rail against the West.\n\nRussia \u201cdoes not refuse dialogue with Western states\u201d, he said.\n\nRather, he said, \u201cthe choice is theirs: do they intend to continue trying to contain Russia, continue the policy of aggression, continuous pressure on our country for years, or look for a path to cooperation and peace\u201d.\n\nSince succeeding President Boris Yeltsin in the waning hours of 1999, Mr Putin has transformed Russia from a country emerging from economic collapse to a pariah state that threatens global security.\n\nFollowing the 2022 invasion of Ukraine that has become Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since the Second World War, Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran and North Korea for support.\n\nHonour guards of the Presidential regiment carry a special copy of the Russian Constitution and the President\u2019s Badge (Alexander Kazakov/AP)\n\nThe question now is what the 71-year-old Mr Putin will do over the course of another six years, both at home and abroad.\n\nRussian forces are gaining ground in Ukraine, deploying scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv grapples with shortages of men and ammunition.\n\nBoth sides are taking heavy casualties.\n\nUkraine has brought the battle to Russian soil through drone and missile attacks, especially in border regions.\n\nVladimir Putin arrives for the ceremony (Sergei Bobylev/AP)\n\nIn a speech in February, Mr Putin vowed to fulfil Moscow\u2019s goals in Ukraine, and do what is needed to \u201cdefend our sovereignty and security of our citizens.\u201d\n\nShortly after his orchestrated re-election in March, Mr Putin suggested that a confrontation between Nato and Russia is possible, and he declared he wanted to carve out a buffer zone in Ukraine to protect his country from cross-border attacks.\n\nAt home, Mr Putin\u2019s popularity is closely tied to improving living standards for ordinary Russians.\n\nHe began his term in 2018 by promising to get Russia into the top five global economies, vowing it should be \u201cmodern and dynamic\u201d.\n\nRussian biker group the Night Wolves leader Alexander Zaldostanov, also known as Khirurg (the Surgeon), arrives for Vladimir Putin\u2019s inauguration ceremony (Alexander Nemenov/AP)\n\nInstead, Russia\u2019s economy has pivoted to a war footing, and authorities are spending record amounts on defence.\n\nAnalysts say now that Mr Putin has secured another six years in power, the government could take the unpopular steps of raising taxes to fund the war and pressure more men to join the military.\n\nAt the start of a new term, the Russian government is routinely dissolved so that Mr Putin can name a new prime minister and Cabinet.\n\nOne key area to watch is the defence ministry.\n\nLast year, defence minister Sergei Shoigu came under pressure over his conduct of the war, with mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin launching withering criticism against him for shortages of ammunition for his private contractors fighting in Ukraine.\n\nMr Prigozhin\u2019s brief uprising in June against the defence ministry represented the biggest threat to Mr Putin\u2019s rule.\n\nAfter Mr Prigozhin was killed two months later in a mysterious plane crash, Mr Shoigu appeared to have survived the infighting.\n\nBut last month, his protege, deputy defence minister Timur Ivanov, was detained on charges of bribery amid reports of rampant corruption.\n\nSome analysts have suggested Mr Shoigu could become a victim of the government reshuffle but that would be a bold move as the war is still raging in Ukraine.\n\nIn the years following the invasion, authorities have cracked down on any form of dissent with a ferocity not seen since Soviet times.\n\nThere is no sign that this repression will ease in Mr Putin\u2019s new term.\n\nHis greatest political foe, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony in February.\n\nOther prominent critics have either been imprisoned or have fled the country, and even some of his opponents abroad fear for their security.\n\nLaws have been enacted that threaten long prison terms for anyone who discredits the military.\n\nThe Kremlin also targets independent media, rights groups, LGBTQ+ activists and others who do not adhere to what Mr Putin has emphasised as Russia\u2019s \u201ctraditional family values\u201d.",

        "content": "Yelizaveta Antonova leaves the journalism college at St. Petersburg State University. She believes a protest of an attack on a reporter cost her a spot in graduate school. (Ksenia Ivanova for The Washington Post)\n\nTwo weeks before the start of his 25th year as Russia\u2019s supreme political leader, Vladimir Putin made a sweeping proclamation: \u201cWars are won by teachers.\u201d The remark, which Putin repeated twice during his year-end news conference in December, shed light on a campaign he is waging that has received little attention outside wartime Russia: to imbue the country\u2019s education system with patriotism, purge universities of Western influences, and quash any dissent among professors and students on campuses that are often hotbeds of political activism.\n\nAt St. Petersburg State University, this meant dismantling a prestigious humanities program called the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences. For more than a decade, until May 2022, the faculty \u2014 or college \u2014 was led by Alexei Kudrin, a liberal economist and former finance minister who had been a close associate of Putin\u2019s since the early 1990s, when they were deputy mayors together in St. Petersburg.\n\n\u201cWe had many classes on U.S. history, American political life, democracy and political thought, as well as courses on Russian history and political science, history of U.S.-Russian relations, and even a course titled \u2018The ABCs of War: Causes, Effects, Consequences,\u2019\u201d said a student at the faculty, also known as Smolny College. \u201cThey are all gone now,\u201d the student said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nSkip to end of carousel About this series \u201cRussia, Remastered\u201d examines how Vladimir Putin, stoking conflict with the West and risking a new world war, is harnessing his invasion of Ukraine to transform Russia and fulfill his revanchist vision of a restored superpower. End of carousel In a radical reshaping of Russia\u2019s education system, curriculums are being redrawn to stress patriotism and textbooks rewritten to belittle Ukraine, glorify Russia and whitewash the totalitarian Soviet past. These changes \u2014 the most sweeping to schooling in Russia since the 1930s \u2014 are a core part of Putin\u2019s effort to harness the war in Ukraine to remaster his country as a regressive, militarized state.\n\nSince the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leaders of Russian universities, which are overwhelmingly funded by the state, have zealously adopted the Kremlin\u2019s intolerance of any dissent or self-organization, according to an extensive examination by The Washington Post of events on campuses across Russia, including interviews with students and professors both still in the country and in exile.\n\nProfessors who spoke out against the war, or allowed safe spaces for students to question it, have been fired. Students who picketed or posted on social media for peace were expelled.\n\nMeanwhile, those who volunteer to fight in Ukraine have been celebrated in line with Putin\u2019s promises that war heroes and their descendants will become the new Russian elite, with enhanced social benefits, including special preference for children seeking to enter top academic programs. Normally, such programs require near-perfect grades and high scores on competitive exams \u2014 uniform standards that applicants from all societal backgrounds have relied on for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the most fundamental precept of academic life \u2014 the freedom to think independently, to challenge conventional assumptions and pursue new, bold ideas \u2014 has been eroded by edicts that classrooms become echo chambers of the authoritarian nativism and historical distortions that Putin uses to justify his war and his will.\n\nAs a result, a system of higher learning that once was a beacon for students across the developing world is now shutting itself off from peer academies in the West, severing one of the few ties that had survived years of political turbulence. Freedom of thought is being trampled, if not eradicated. Eminent scholars have fled for positions abroad, while others said in interviews that they are planning to do so.\n\nAt the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, officials last July created the Ivan Ilyin Higher Political School, which is now being led by Alexander Dugin, a fervent pro-Putin and Orthodox Christian ideologue who was tasked with \u201crevising domestic scientific and educational paradigms and bringing them into line with our traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been a catastrophic degradation in Western humanitarian history,\u201d Dugin said at a January seminar on transforming Russian humanities education. \u201cThis is evidenced by gender problems, postmodernism and ultraliberalism. We can study the West, but not as the ultimate universal truth. We need to focus on our own Russian development model.\u201d\n\nSkip to end of carousel How we reported \u2018Russia, Remastered\u2019 arrow left arrow right For this article, Russia reporter Mary Iluyshina reported from Riga, Latvia, and Berlin, communicating by phone and social media with Russian students and professors in the country and those who have fled. Many experienced the transformation of Russia\u2019s educational system firsthand. Information they provided was corroborated by court documents, independent Russian news accounts, social media posts, and other documentary evidence. The Post also relied on Kremlin transcripts of remarks by President Vladimir, government decrees, and official statements issued by universities. Photographer Ksenia Ivanova reported from St. Petersburg. Reporting on Russia is challenging, and it has grown more difficult since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At times, people in Russia are afraid to speak with journalists or to say things that they worry could provoke the authorities. Many people in Russia avoid speaking in public about politics or the war in Ukraine, fearing they could be reported to the authorities by neighbors or by classmates . Some analysts still inside the country are known to comment carefully, wary of provoking the Kremlin. For these reasons, The Post agreed to withhold the identities of some people interviewed who expressed concerns about their safety. For those reluctant to meet in person because of security concerns, we agreed to conduct interviews on encrypted internet platforms. Mary Ilyushina, a Post reporter covering Russia since 2021, previously worked for CNN\u2019s Moscow bureau as a field producer. She speaks Russian, English, Ukrainian and Arabic and is a graduate of Moscow State University. Robyn Dixon, The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau chief since November 2019, is on her third stint covering Russia, having had previous assignments with the Los Angeles Times and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age dating back to 1993. She speaks Russian, French and English. Francesca Ebel, a Russia correspondent for The Post since November 2022, previously covered Russia and Ukraine as a multimedia journalist for the Associated Press was an AP correspondent based in Tunis. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in medieval and modern languages from Cambridge University, where she studied Russian, Ukrainian and French. Natalia Abbakumova has been a researcher and translator in The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau since 2001, collaborating during that time with 10 bureau chiefs. Previously, she worked briefly for The Economist. She holds a degree in foreign languages (English and German) from Moscow Linguistic University. 1 / 4 End of carousel Last month, students pushed an online petition to protest the naming of the school after Ilyin, a philosopher who defended Hitler and Mussolini in World War II and advocated for the return of czarist autocracy in Russia. In a statement to Tass, the state-controlled news service, the university denounced the petition as \u201cpart of the information war of the West and its supporters against Russia\u201d and asserted, without providing evidence, that the group behind it had no connection to students at the school. Programs specializing in the liberal arts and sciences are primary targets because they are viewed as breeding grounds for dissent. Major universities have cut the hours spent studying Western governments, human rights and international law, and even the English language. \u201cWe were destroyed,\u201d said Denis Skopin, a philosophy professor at Smolny College who was fired for criticizing the war. \u201cBecause the last thing people who run universities need are unreliable actors who do the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing, think in a different way, and teach their students to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College\n\nSt. Petersburg State University, commonly known as SPbU, has long been one of Russia\u2019s premier academies of higher learning. It is the alma mater of both Putin, who graduated with a degree in law in 1975, and former president Dmitry Medvedev, who received his law degree 12 years later and now routinely threatens nuclear strikes on the West as deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s national security council.\n\nIn many ways, the university has become the leader in reprisals against students and staff not loyal to the Kremlin, with one newspaper dubbing it the \u201crepressions champion\u201d of Russian education. Its halls have become a microcosm of modern Russia in which conservatives in power are pushing out the few remaining Western-oriented liberals.\n\nLike other aspects of Putin\u2019s remastering of Russia \u2014 such as patriotic mandates in the arts and the redrawing of the role of women to focus on childbearing \u2014 the shift in education started well before the invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, Russia ended a more than 20-year-old exchange program between Smolny College and Bard College in New York state by designating the private American liberal arts school an \u201cundesirable\u201d organization.\n\nJonathan Becker, Bard\u2019s vice president for academic affairs and a professor of political studies, said the demise of Smolny was emblematic of a wider shift in Russia as well as a new intolerance of the West.\n\n\u201cA huge number of faculty have been let go, several departments closed, core liberal arts programs which focus on critical thinking have been eliminated,\u201d Becker said. \u201cAll of that has happened, and it\u2019s not just happened at Smolny \u2014 it has happened elsewhere. But we were doubly problematic because we both represent critical thinking and partnership with the West. And neither of those are acceptable in present-day Russia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2022, in a scene captured on video and posted on social media, dozens of students gathered in a courtyard to bid a tearful goodbye to Skopin, Smolny\u2019s cherished philosophy professor who was fired for an \u201cimmoral act\u201d \u2014 protesting Putin\u2019s announcement of a partial military mobilization to replenish his depleted forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe month before, according to court records and interviews, Skopin was arrested at an antiwar rally. He ended up sharing a jail cell with another professor, Artem Kalmykov, a young mathematician who had recently finished his PhD at the University of Zurich.\n\nThat fall, the university launched an overhaul that all but shut Smolny College and replaced the curriculum with a thoroughly revamped arts and humanities program.\n\nThe dismantling of Smolny marked the resolution of a years-long feud between Kudrin, the liberal-economist dean, and Nikolai Kropachev, the university rector, whom tutors and students described as a volatile character with a passion for building ties in the highest echelons of the government.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College\n\nIn February, Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service, sent a heartfelt birthday message to Kropachev, thanking him for his \u201ccivic and political activity\u201d and for \u201ccomprehensive assistance in replenishing personnel.\u201d\n\nOne student described how Kropachev once interrupted a meeting with students and hinted that he needed to take a call from Putin, in what the student viewed as a boast of his direct access to the Russian leader. Both St. Petersburg State University and Moscow State University were assigned a special status in 2009, under which their rectors are appointed personally by the president.\n\nSkopin, who earned his PhD in France, and his cellmate, Kalmykov, were perfect examples of the type of academic that Russia aspired to attract from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s \u2014 enticed after studying abroad to bring knowledge home amid booming investment in higher education. But by 2022, the system seemed to have no need for them.\n\nVideo of the gathering in the courtyard shows students erupting in sustained applause, and one student coming forward to hug Skopin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it,\u201d Skopin said.\n\nAfter his dismissal, some students tried to fight the administration\u2019s plan to dismantle the Smolny program.\n\n\u201cAt one point we found ourselves in a situation where out of 30 original faculty staff, we had just three tutors left,\u201d said Polina Ulanovskaya, a sociology student and activist who led the student union. \u201cAnd the quality of education definitely suffered, especially all of the politics-related classes.\u201d\n\nUlanovskaya said that on the political science track, only two professors have stayed, and many classes were eliminated, including a human rights course. There are now just two courses offered in English, down from 21.\n\nWith every new professor, Ulanovskaya said, she felt a need to test the waters. Would the word \u201cgender\u201d trigger them? Could she say something opposition-leaning? What would be a red flag?\n\nUlanovskaya opted out of writing a thesis on her main research topic \u2014 Russian social movements, politicization of workers and historic-preservation activists \u2014 out of fear that it would be blacklisted. Instead, she wrote about Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe main problem at the faculty now is that there is no freedom and especially no sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess there is no such thing anywhere in Russia now ... you can\u2019t trust anyone in any university.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after The Post interviewed Ulanovskaya last fall, she was expelled, formally for failing an exam, but she and Skopin said they believe it was retaliation for her activism.\n\nAnother student, Yelizaveta Antonova, was supposed to get her bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism just days after legendary Novaya Gazeta newspaper reporter Yelena Milashina was brutally beaten in Chechnya, the small Muslim-majority republic in southern Russia under the dictatorial rule of Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nAntonova, who interned at Novaya Gazeta and looked up to Milashina, felt she could not accept her diploma without showing support for her colleague. She and a roommate printed a photo of Milashina, depicting the reporter\u2019s shaved head and bandaged hands, to stage a demonstration at their graduation ceremony \u2014 much to the dismay of other classmates, who sought to block the protest.\n\n\u201cThey essentially prevented us from going on stage,\u201d Antonova said. \u201cSo we did it outside of the law school, and we felt it was extra symbolic because Putin and Medvedev studied in these halls.\u201d\n\nThey held up the poster for about half an hour, until another student threatened them by saying riot police were on the way to arrest them. Antonova believes the protest cost her a spot in graduate school, where she hoped to continue her research comparing Russia\u2019s media landscape before and after the invasion.\n\nEight months after the graduation ceremony, authorities launched a case against Antonova and her roommate for staging an unauthorized demonstration \u2014 an administrative offense that is punishable by a fine and puts people on law enforcement\u2019s radar. Antonova left the country to continue her studies abroad.\n\nIdeological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides\n\nThe history college at St. Petersburg State has long been a battleground for various ideologies, with cliques ranging from conservatives and Kremlin loyalists to unyielding opposition-minded liberals, according to interviews with students and professors.\n\nThe February 2022 invasion of Ukraine caused a deeper split. Some students and professors openly praised Putin\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d as the Kremlin called the war, while others joined rallies against it.\n\n\u201cThe war gave them carte blanche,\u201d said Michael Martin, 22, a former star at the college \u2014 to which he was automatically admitted after winning two nationwide academic competitions and where he earned straight A\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartin was a leader of the student council, which on the day of the invasion issued an antiwar manifesto quickly drafted in a cafe.\n\nAnother history student, Fedor Solomonov, took the opposite view and praised the special military operation on social media. When Solomonov was called up as part of the mobilization, he declined to take a student deferral and went to fight. He died on the front on April 1, 2023.\n\nSoon after Solomonov\u2019s death, screenshots from internal chats where students often debated history and politics were leaked and went viral on pro-war Telegram channels. In some, Martin and other classmates expressed antiwar sentiments, while another showed a message \u2014 allegedly written by an assistant professor, Mikhail Belousov \u2014 vaguely describing events in Ukraine as \u201cRashism,\u201d a wordplay combining \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201cfascism.\u201d\n\nIn an aggressive online campaign, pro-war activists demanded that Belousov, who denied writing the message, be fired and that the antiwar students, whom they labeled \u201ca pro-Ukrainian organized crime group,\u201d be expelled.\n\n\u201cA cell of anti-Russian students led by a Russophobe associate professor is operating at the history faculty,\u201d read posts on Readovka, a radical outlet with 2.5 million followers. \u201cThey are rabid liberals who hate their country.\u201d Belousov was dismissed and seven students, including Martin, were accused of desecrating Solomonov\u2019s memory and expelled.\n\nBelousov has gone underground and could not be reached for comment.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThey essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil,\u201d Martin said, recalling the expulsion hearing, where he said the committee repeatedly asked leading questions trying to get him to say the war was justified. The committee also asked him repeatedly about Solomonov.\n\n\u201cI said he was for the war and I was against it \u2014 we could argue about that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t find anything funny or interesting in this \u2014 I\u2019m truly sorry for what happened to him, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that he did something good or great by going to war.\u201d\n\nMartin said that as the war raged on, the university began \u201cglorifying death\u201d and praising alumni who had joined the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis narrative also warped the curriculum.\n\nA few weeks into the invasion, the school introduced a class on modern Ukrainian history, with a course description asserting that Ukrainian statehood is based \u201con a certain mythology.\u201d\n\n\u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University\n\nBelousov, the former assistant professor, criticized a course titled \u201cThe Great Patriotic War: No Statute of Limitations,\u201d taught by an instructor with a degree in library science. The key message of the course is that the Soviet Union had no role in the start of World War II \u2014 a denial of Russia\u2019s joint invasion of Poland with Nazi Germany in 1939.\n\nAccording to a government document reviewed by The Post, Russia\u2019s Higher Education Ministry plans to introduce this course at other universities to ensure the \u201ccivic-patriotic and spiritual-moral education of youth,\u201d specifically future lawyers, teachers and historians, and to \u201ccorrect false ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are obviously propaganda courses that are aimed at turning historians into court apologists,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMartin was expelled days before he was supposed to defend his thesis. He quickly left the country after warnings that he and his classmates could be charged with discrediting the army, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. A criminal case was initiated against Belousov on charges of rehabilitating Nazism.\n\n\u201cThis is all very reminiscent of the Stalinist 1930s purges,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe limit of tolerated protest now is to sit silently and say nothing. There is despair at the faculty and a feeling that they have crushed everything.\u201d\n\nNew Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite\n\nTo lure more Russian men to fight in Ukraine, the government has promised their families various sweeteners, including cheap mortgages, large life insurance payments and education benefits for their children.\n\nIn 2022, Putin approved changes to education laws to grant children of soldiers who fought in Ukraine admissions preferences at Russia\u2019s best universities \u2014 schools that normally accept only students with near-perfect exam scores and impressive high school records.\n\nNow, at least 10 percent of all fully funded university spots must be allocated to students eligible for the military preference. Those whose fathers were killed or wounded do not need to pass entry exams.\n\nThe new law solidified a previous Putin decree that gave special preferences to soldiers and their children. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 8,500 students were enrolled based on these preferences, government officials said. According to an investigation by the Russian-language outlet Important Stories, nearly 900 students were admitted to 13 top universities through war quotas, with most failing to meet the normal exam score threshold.\n\nIn areas of Ukraine captured by Russian forces since February 2022, a different takeover of the education system is underway, with Moscow imposing its curriculum and standards just as it did after invading and illegally annexing Crimea in 2014.\n\nFor the 2023-24 academic year, according to the Russian prime minister\u2019s office, more than 5 percent of fully state-financed tuition stipends \u2014 roughly 37,000 out of 626,000 \u2014 were allocated for students at universities in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson or Zaporizhzhia, the four occupied or partly occupied areas of Ukraine that Putin has claimed to be annexed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relatively large allocation of tuition aid in occupied areas shows how financial assistance and education are central to Putin\u2019s effort to seize lands in southeast Ukraine and absorb its population into Russia in violation of international law.\n\nDeans of several leading Russian universities have made highly publicized trips to occupied Ukraine to urge students there to enroll into Russian schools, part of a multipronged effort to bring residents into Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe Moscow-based Higher School of Economics, once considered Russia\u2019s most liberal university, recently established patronage over universities in Luhansk, with Rector Nikita Anisimov often traveling there.\n\nAn inward turn An inward turn An inward turn An inward turn\n\nA few weeks after the invasion started, Moscow abandoned the Bologna Process, a pan-European effort to align higher education standards, as Russia\u2019s deans and rectors strove to show they weren\u2019t susceptible to foreign influence.\n\nHigher Education Minister Valery Falkov said Russian universities would undergo significant changes in the next half-decade, overseen by the national program \u201cPriority 2030,\u201d which envisions curriculums that ensure \u201cformation of a patriotic worldview in young people.\u201d\n\nSoon after Russia quit the Bologna Process, Smolny College was targeted for overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe decision was an expected but distinct shift from the more liberal model of Russian higher education policy that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union,\u201d said Victoria Pardini, a program associate at the Kennan Institute, a Washington think tank focused on Russia.\n\nAnother prestigious school, the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, canceled its liberal arts program in 2022 after authorities accused it of \u201cdestroying national values.\u201d\n\nIn mid-October 2023, the Higher Education Ministry ordered universities to avoid open discussion of \u201cnegative political, economic and social trends,\u201d according to a publicly disclosed report by British intelligence. \u201cIn the longer term, this will likely further the trend of Russian policymaking taking place in an echo-chamber,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nRussia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge\n\nMany international exchange programs have been canceled \u2014 some because Russian students now have difficulty obtaining visas.

Cameron's hostile attack directly contradicts the previously sounded assurances of the British side when transferring long-range cruise missiles to the Kyiv regime, that under no circumstances would they be used on Russian territory,\" the statement continued. \"Thus, the head of the Foreign Office disavowed this position, de facto recognizing his country as a party to the conflict.\"\n\nThe ministry said that the Russian side \"views D. Cameron's words as evidence of a serious escalation and confirmation of London's increasing involvement in military operations on the side of Kyiv.\"\n\nUS ARMY SOLDIER DETAINED IN RUSSIA, CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT: OFFICIALS\n\n\"N. Casey was warned that the response to Ukrainian strikes using British weapons on Russian territory could be any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and beyond,\" the ministry said. \"The Ambassador was called upon to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London and to immediately refute in the most decisive and unequivocal manner the bellicose provocative statements of the head of the Foreign Office.\"\n\nThe remarks came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nDrills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons come in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" Russia's Defense Ministry also said in a statement. It was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons \u2014 massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.\n\n\"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" Dujarric said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\"\n\nRUSSIAN JOURNALIST CHARGED WITH 'JUSTIFYING TERRORISM' OVER YEARS-OLD TELEGRAM POSTS\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine\u2019s Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine\u2019s Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and Cameron said Kyiv\u2019s forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\n\"Ukraine has that right. Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" Cameron told Reuters last week.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron\u2019s recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It\u2019s a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It\u2019s unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry also summoned France's ambassador.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Read more CNN Opinion.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOn Thursday Russia will celebrate Victory Day, its commemoration of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Domestically, this is nostalgia. In the 1970s, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev created a cult of victory. Russia under Putin has continued the tradition.\n\nAbroad, this is intimidation. We are meant to think that Russia cannot lose.\n\nAnd far too many of us, during Russia\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine, have believed that. In February 2022, when Russia undertook its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, the consensus was that Ukraine would fall within days.\n\nEven today, when Ukraine has held its own for more than two years, the prevailing view among Russia\u2019s friends in Congress and in the Senate is that Russia must eventually win. Moscow\u2019s success is not on the battlefield, but in our minds.\n\nRussia can lose. And it should lose, for the sake of the world \u2014 and for its own sake.\n\nRussian soldiers patrol Mariupol's drama theater, southeastern Ukraine, in March 2022. Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe notion of an invincible Red Army is propaganda. The Red Army was formidable, but it was also beatable. Of its three most consequential foreign wars, the Red Army lost two.\n\nIt was defeated by Poland in 1920. It defeated Nazi Germany in 1945, after nearly collapsing in 1941. (Its win in that instance was part of a larger coalition and with decisive American economic assistance.) Soviet forces were in trouble in Afghanistan immediately after their 1979 invasion and had to withdraw a decade later.\n\nAnd the Russian army of today is not the Red Army. Russia is not the USSR. Soviet Ukraine was a source of resources and soldiers for the Red Army. In that victory of 1945, Ukrainian soldiers in the Red Army took huge losses \u2014 greater than American, British and French losses combined. It was disproportionately Ukrainians who fought their war to Berlin in the uniform of the Red Army.\n\nToday, Russia is fighting not together with Ukraine but against Ukraine. It is fighting a war of aggression on the territory of another state. And it lacks the American economic support \u2014 Lend-Lease \u2014 that the Red Army needed to defeat Nazi Germany. In this constellation, there is no particular reason to expect Russia to win. One would expect, instead, that Russia\u2019s only chance is to prevent the West from helping Ukraine \u2014 by persuading us that its victory is inevitable, so that we don\u2019t apply our decisive economic power.\n\nThe last six months bear this out: Russia\u2019s minor battlefield victories came at a time when the United States was delaying Ukraine aid, rather than supplying it.\n\nToday\u2019s Russia is a new state. It has existed since 1991. Like Brezhnev before him, Russian President Vladimir Putin rules through nostalgia. He refers to the Soviet and also the Russian imperial past. But the Russian Empire also lost wars. It lost the Crimean War in 1856. It lost the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It lost the First World War in 1917. In none of those three cases was Russia able to keep forces in the field for more than about three years.\n\nIn the United States there is great nervousness about a Russian defeat. If something seems impossible, we cannot imagine what could happen next. And so there is a tendency, even among supporters of Ukraine, to think that the best resolution is a tie.\n\nSuch thinking is unrealistic. And it reveals, behind the nerves, a strange American conceit.\n\nNo one can guide a war in such a way. And nothing in our prior attempts to influence Russia suggests that we can exercise that kind of influence. Russia and Ukraine are both fighting to win. The questions are: who will win, and with what consequences?\n\nIf Russia wins, the consequences are horrifying: a risk of a larger war in Europe, more likelihood of a Chinese adventure in the Pacific, the weakening of international legal order generally, the likely spread of nuclear weapons, the loss of faith in democracy.\n\nSoviet soldiers during a patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan, April 25, 1988. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in late 1979 and remained there until 1989. Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nIt is normal for Russia to lose wars. And, in general, this led Russians to reflect and reform. Defeat in Crimea forced an autocracy to end serfdom. Russia\u2019s loss to Japan led to an experiment with elections. The Soviet failure in Afghanistan led to Gorbachev\u2019s reforms and thus the end of the cold war.\n\nBeneath the Russian particularities, history offers a more general and still more reassuring lesson about empires. Russia is fighting today an imperial war. It denies the existence of the Ukrainian state and nation, and it carries out atrocities that recall the worst of the European imperial past.\n\nThe peaceful Europe of today consists of powers that lost their last imperial wars and then chose democracy. It is not only possible to lose your last imperial war: it is also good, not only for the world, but for you.\n\nRussia can lose this war, and should, for the sake of Russians themselves. A defeated Russia means not only the end of senseless losses of young life in Ukraine. It is also Russia\u2019s one chance to become a post-imperial country, one where reform is possible, one where Russians themselves might be protected by law and able to cast meaningful votes.\n\nDefeat in Ukraine is Russia\u2019s historical chance for normality \u2014 as Russians who want democracy and the rule of law will say.\n\nLike the United States and Europe, Ukraine celebrates the victory of 1945 on May 8th rather than May 9th. Ukrainians have every right to remember and interpret that victory: they suffered more than Russians from German occupation and died in huge numbers on the battlefield.\n\nAnd Ukrainians are right to think that Russia today, like Nazi Germany in 1945, is a fascist imperialist regime that can and must be defeated. Fascism was defeated last time because a coalition held firm and applied its superior economic power. The same holds true now.",

        "content": "During these May days, when we remember our common victory - the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, we would like to recall the words of the Belarusian president: \u201cThe more time passes from the heroic and tragic events, the more we venerate the sacrificial feat of our grandfathers and great grandfathers, those, who saved the mankind from enslavement and extermination.\u201d But let's figure out why the more time passes, the stronger is our desire to stand up for truth and justice, and the more fiercely the West holds onto global dominance. Why the farther we are from those events, the more careful we are of our historical memory and the more barbaric our neighbors are towards war monuments. The war crimes have no statute of limitations, do they? We discuss this in a new episode of BelTA\u2019s Youtube project \u201cAfter the Fact: Lukashenko\u2019s Decisions\u201d.\n\nWhat was the war for Belarusians?\n\nSome chided Belarus for its over-focus on the war commemoration as if no important events happened ever since. To be honest, until recently, some of us teased the older generation over their \"anything but war\" mantra and the traditional wishes for a peaceful sky. It turned out that it was a mistake. Big mistake.\n\nThe great Russian commander Alexander Suvorov is credited with the following words: \u201cThe war is not over until the last soldier is buried!\" He is believed to have said them after the defeat of the Turkish army at the Battle of Rymnik. Russia lost a couple of hundred people in that battle\u2026\n\nNow let's get back to our history. In April 2021, the General Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal case into the genocide of the population of Belarus during the Great Patriotic War and the post-war period. the German invaders and their accomplices killed more than three million Belarusians. Almost 400,000 people were taken to Germany for slave labor. More than 12,000 villages were completely or partially destroyed. Several hundred of them shared the sad fate of Khatyn. More than 580 death camps were established on the territory of our country, and almost 200 major punitive operations were carried out. \"The investigation of the criminal case into the genocide of the Belarusian people continues. For a little more than three years of the investigation, we obtained the information confirming that the scale of the tragedy during the Great Patriotic War is much greater than previously thought. One of the goals of the investigation is to establish all the facts of the genocide that took place on the territory of our country during the Great Patriotic War. But the most important goal is to bring to justice all Nazi criminals who committed atrocities against the Belarusian people. We are moving towards this goal. As part of the criminal case we have put together a list of henchmen and their accomplices that will soon be persecuted by the Prosecutor General of Belarus,\u201d said Sergei Shikunets, Deputy Head of the Department for Supervision over the Investigation of Particularly Important Criminal Cases of the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\nIf we apply Suvorov's words to our realities, will the war ever end for Belarusians?\n\nThis is why the memory of those who died in the fight for the freedom and independence of our Motherland, for the liberation of the planet from Nazism, the memory of the victims of Nazism is sacred for our people. This has become part of the national idea.\n\n\u201cRecently we hear more people say: \u2018What do we need this for. Let us forget everything\u2019. A hideous thing hides behind these seemingly harmless words. It is an attempt not only to forget but also rewrite the history of the war, take away the feat of our people. We must not forget it. We must not give Great Victory away. It is a testimony of the greatness of the Soviet people whose descendants we are,\u201d Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said at a ceremony to unveil the Trostenets Memorial in 2015.\n\nApproaches by Belarus and its neighbors to honoring the past\n\nLet's compare. In 2020, the Ola memorial was opened in Svetlogorsk District on the site of the village destroyed during the war. Almost 2,000 people were burned here, more than half of them were children. That's twelve Khatyns! In the same year, a monument to the burned villages was dedicated in Mogilev Oblast.\n\nTwo years ago, the Khatyn memorial complex was declared an all-Belarusian construction site. Student teams from all over Belarus worked here. The project was financed from the budget and also with the money earned during the national cleanup day. All in all, about Br5 million was spent on the renovation of the memorial. Roughly speaking, it was $1.5-2 million. In 2023, more than 500,000 people visited Khatyn, which was almost twice as many as in previous years. Such a flow of tourists was associated with the opening of a unique museum here.\n\nAt the same time, Latvia was busy too: the Riga City Council proposed to demolish the monument to the Liberators of Riga. This idea was supported by the president of the country. The city authorities bulldozed the flowers laid at the memorial, opened criminal and administrative cases against the protesters, promised to expel from the country all foreigners who joined the protesters... It came to the point of absurd: they decided to drain the pond near the monument and feed the fish to animals in Riga Zoo. The dismantling of the memorial in honor of Soviet soldiers cost \u20ac2 million. It turned out that this was just the beginning: the Latvian government had prepared a list of 69 Soviet war memorials to be demolished.\n\nLatvia\u2019s actions were not unique for Europe. Poland has been implementing its decommunization law since 2017. The dismantling of Soviet monuments and memorials in honor of the liberators has become almost a national idea in Estonia and Lithuania. Ukraine has eagerly joined this dance on the bones.\n\nIt became almost a matter of honor for Kiev to replace the Soviet emblem on Europe\u2019s highest monument with the Ukrainian trident coat of arms. The project to \u2018decommunize\u2019 the Ukrainian Motherland monument cost about $500,000. This is not about money (although it could have been used to address more pressing problems in Ukraine). The question is whether such \u201crebranding\u201d made Ukraine greater. After all Kiev, Minsk, Moscow, and other capitals of the post-Soviet republics survived thanks to those whom these monuments commemorate!\n\n\u201cToday you and I wonder about the same thing: could the heroes of the war have imagined that 80 years later their children and grandchildren would have to fight for the truth about the Great Victory, for the right to honor the victorious warriors on this holy day? Today we should openly speak about the fact that during the Great Patriotic War Belarusian civilian population was subjected to a massive and systemic extermination. We will never forget that millions of our compatriots fell on battlefields, perished in death camps, were hanged, shot or tortured to death by gestapo. We remember it and if someone forgets it, we will remind them,\u201d the Belarusian president said in 2021.\n\nWhom does the memory of the victims and heroes of the war give hard time today?\n\n\u201cThe memory of the victims of the war, the heroism of our fathers and grandfathers gives a hard time to some people, first of all, to the ideological followers of murderers and traitors. It is they who honor the executioners in their parliaments today. It was they who started the war against graves and monuments in Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine. Complete madmen! Do they think that by destroying a monument they will destroy the memory that lives in the hearts of the people? The people who found the strength to build new peaceful relations with those states that only yesterday brought suffering and death to our lands,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko said as he attended a ceremony together with Russian President Vladimir Putin to unveil the memorial to the USSR civilians who fell victim of Nazi genocide during Great Patriotic War in January 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this great monument bear importance for our peoples? After all, there are thousands of war monuments in Russia and Belarus. Everything is simple. The overwhelming majority of them honor the heroes - Red Army soldiers and partisans, the people who defended their land with weapons in their hands. It is as important to pay tribute to the people who could not defend themselves.\n\n\u201cThe Prosecutor General's Office of Belarus nominated Brest Fortress for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List as a memorial symbolizing the fight against Nazism, the fight against the policy of genocide throughout the world. The Prosecutor General's Office also suggested awarding the international status of historical and cultural heritage to the Trostenets concentration camp, which was the largest one in terms of the number of people killed there. Large-scale work is conducted to set up expositions dedicated to the genocide of the Belarusian people in all corners of our country. Together with the Education Ministry we have prepared supplements about the genocide of the Belarusian people to the history textbooks,\u201d representative of the General Prosecutor's Office Sergei Shikunets said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war\u201d\n\nAgain we may ask a rhetorical question: why our European neighbors are deeply preoccupied with demolishing Soviet memorials? Why do Belarus and Russia try their best to perpetuate the memory of that terrible tragedy? A common tragedy for all our peoples.\n\nDuring that ceremony Aleksandr Lukashenko reminded us of a simple truth: we cannot change the past, but it is in our power to protect the future. For this, we should cherish our common historical memory, the brotherhood of peoples and the unbreakable unity of the nations that fought against the world evil and defeated it. At a time when some forces prefer to forget the terrible pages of the Second World War, try to shift the accents in terms of responsibility of some countries, Belarus stands guards of the true history. Not only in stone. Back in October 2004 Aleksandr Lukashenko signed a decree to establish a new insignia - a pennant \u2018For valor and perseverance during the Great Patriotic War\u2019. It was awarded to 36 settlements of Belarus. Each of these places became a true citadel of fortitude, where both soldiers and local residents showed incredible bravery.\n\n\u201cAs long as we build monuments, as long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war, we will avoid such terrible tragedies. As soon as we forget the way to these holy places, a war will certainly follow,\u201d the Belarusian leader warned.\n\nIs it possible to forgive the Nazis\u2019 crimes?\n\nThanks to search operations, many horrifying facts have been uncovered and new evidence of terrible crimes has been discovered over the past three years.\n\n\u201cThe German fascist invaders and their accomplices spared no one: either children, or the elderly, or women. In this exhibit we see fragments of shoes found at the excavation site in Ivanovshchina Forest in Logoisk District, Minsk Oblast. In that pit of about 80 meters in diameter we found bone remains belonging to at least 1,021 people. The most horrifying thing is that we found skeletal remains of children and women. We had to remove the bone remains with our own hands. It was really hard to do this emotionally because we understood we were touching history. It was hard to imagine what happened in that place 80 years ago: people waiting for their death near the pit. People were brought to the edge of the pit, forced to their knees and shot dead. Those who were wounded were simply buried alive,\u201d Sergei Shikunets said.\n\nThousands of concentration camp prisoners have shared their memories. Their stories leave no one indifferent. We would like to tell you about the fate of one girl - Emilia Kopytok. She, a 10-year-old red-haired girl then, called Squirrel by her loving parents, went through six concentration camps. And she survived! The child saw baths with human fat from which soap was made, saw little children and their mothers brutally murdered. Is it possible to forgive such things? Is it possible to forget?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we were allowed to get off carriages, I saw a forest, German guards and German shepherd dogs. And a huge bonfire. Nearby there was another train full of Jews. The Jews were also getting off train, and mothers were carrying small children in their arms. They were all very pretty and curly-haired. These children were grabbed and thrown into the bonfire. The mothers who ran after their children screaming were bayoneted and thrown into the fire too. There was terrible screaming, terrible howling, terrible crying, terrible barking of dogs. The bonfire was burning like a candle,\u201d Emilia Kopytok said.\n\nBelarusians are a strong nation. Strong because they never forget. Strong because they are ready to forgive. But is it really a time to forgive?",

Territory in the east had been captured slowly, he said, and \u201cat even higher cost in men and material and to the national economy of Russia\u201d.\n\nThe west, if it acted, had the capacity to support Ukraine with \u201cmillions of rounds of ammunition, thousands of drones, hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles\u201d, he said, while Russia would have to \u201ctwist its economy out of shape to sustain the war\u201d, widely expected to last into 2025.\n\nUkraine, the Middle East and China were interlinked by \u201ca battle of ideas\u201d, Radakin said, between \u201can authoritarian and belligerent Russia and a dynamic, democratic Ukraine\u201d and \u201cbetween a reckless Iran and its terrorist network on one side, and the responsible nations of the Middle East on the other\u201d.\n\nHe warned of a split \u201cbetween a China that believes it can dominate and coerce, and those nations that share a commitment to an international system that is open and free\u201d \u2013 an effort to link future funding of Ukraine with more established US concerns about the security of Israel and the rising power of Beijing.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although it was after the Second World War that we managed to wrest from each other this commitment to never fight again, effectively putting an end to the killing of millions that had been going on for centuries in Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe Austrian chancellor stressed that everyone must be vigilant when someone is trying to pass off a criminal as victim in Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\n\"We must be vigilant when we think and talk about defensive democracy and defense, so as not to allow the criminal to become a victim as radicals sometimes try to do as regards Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" Nehammer emphasized.\n\nAccording to the chancellor, it is also necessary to be vigilant in the matter of a terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. In this context, he noted that the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could end with the capitulation of Hamas \u2013 and this should be a \"clear demand from the West.\"\n\nAs Ukrinform reported, the right-wing populist Austrian Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), known for its pro-Russian position, used an anti-Ukrainian poster in its campaign for the European Parliament elections.\n\nRead also: Ukrainian diplomats and community commemorate victims of Mauthausen camp in Austria\n\nIn this regard, the Embassy of Ukraine sent an official note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Austria, condemning the strategy of the FP\u00d6 to manipulatively and distortedly portray the reasons and essence of Russia's full-scale aggression, \"which, among other things, is an insult to the Ukrainian people that creates grounds for justifying Russia\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine\".\n\nPhoto: President\u2019s Office",

I come to listen and to learn first,\" Moroz told Fox News Digital. \"If I can model a faith that is curious and humble, as well as courageous \u2014 that\u2019s what I want these chaplains to bring to the soldiers they serve.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Moroz to learn more about the very recent creation of Ukraine's chaplaincy corps, how its clerics and faith leaders operate, and the challenges they face alongside normal combatants.\n\nUKRAINE BUSTS UP RUSSIA'S ZELENSKYY ASSASSINATION PLOT IN MASSIVE 'FAILURE' OF PUTIN'S SPIES\n\nChaplains in the Ukrainian conflict are divided into two groups \u2014 enlisted soldiers and volunteers supported by churches or regional dioceses.\n\nThe Military Chaplaincy Service is a brand-new structure within the Ukrainian armed forces, introduced in 2022 by an act of the nation's parliament. Prior to its introduction, the only spiritual support provided to soldiers was auxiliary programs run independently by churches.\n\nTraining for chaplains inside and outside the armed forces is disorganized and lacks standardization. Many are forced to learn on the job and pick up pastoral skills as they go.\n\nUkraine is an overwhelmingly Christian country with a solid Eastern Orthodox majority, followed by a smaller contingency of Catholics, and an even smaller Protestant minority.\n\nSergii Dadsko \u2014 a chaplain who began volunteering in 2014 working with civilian refugees \u2014 now puts most of his effort into serving soldiers. He studied at a seminary before the invasion, but says most of his training has been through his wartime ministry.\n\nRUSSIA'S KREMLIN PARADES WESTERN EQUIPMENT CAPTURES FROM UKRAINIAN ARMY AT EXHIBITION\n\nMykhailo Hryhoruk is a member of Olive Branch, an organization coordinating religious support for years across Ukraine. Olive Branch has given Mykhailo opportunities to take courses and attend seminary classes in Kyiv and Ryvne.\n\nThe pair work together, often coordinating relief for soldiers coming out of combat to resupply or due to injuries. The chaplains help soldiers find showers and a place to rest. They serve all members of the military, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.\n\nIn between the logistical work of caring for the wounded and exhausted, they find time to read Scripture and invite others to join them.\n\nThe work is crucial, Moroz says, as Ukrainian society continues suffering an overwhelming mental toll in the face of massive casualties.\n\n\"In the midst of trauma and conflict, I have personally experienced both individuals who are finding their faith and actively expressing it, and individuals who are experiencing a crisis of faith,\" Moroz told Fox News Digital. \"I would say the longer this war goes, the more I see discouragement and hardening of hearts. I heard one of the volunteers say this week, trauma will either drown you (harden you) or it will teach you how to float (it will tenderize your heart).\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMoroz, through his Renewal Initiative program, is one of many foreign faith leaders entering Ukraine in order to support those aiding the soldiers.\n\n\"I just finished a three-day retreat on a beautiful (and peaceful) camp property outside of Kyiv. We had between 80\u2013100 chaplains and civilian volunteers that have been actively serving others during the last two years (some longer - since 2014),\" Moroz said. \"I brought four mental health specialists with me and three other pastors. We had self-care/self-assessment sessions based around physical, emotional, and spiritual care. Outside of the sessions, the guests set counseling appointments with the therapists.\"\n\nHe continued, \"With the help of donors from the United States, we were able to purchase delicious and wholesome food, hire massage therapists, and provide a sauna experience. There were also moments of prayer for personal health and the country of Ukraine. We were told that this is something that is desperately needed in Ukraine and does not exist broadly.\"\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is now in its second year. Hard figures on military and civilian casualties are impossible to accurately calculate, but numbers in the tens of thousands for both sides.",

        "content": "Since the beginning of the New Year, Russia has embarked on a massive onslaught targeting Ukrainian cities on a par with its bombing blitz at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. This offensive assault was not surprising as Russia was believed to be purposely accumulating missiles and drones in the final several months of 2023. However, the source of some of the missiles used in Russia\u2019s most recent bombing missions has touched off some serious consternation in Ukraine and in Western capitals.\n\nIn reaction to these latest barrages of bombs, the White House claimed that Russia had used North Korean ballistic missiles to strike Ukraine. This announcement was later verified by senior Ukrainian officials. On Jan. 9, 2024, the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, the European Union and some 40 additional partner countries denounced North Korea\u2019s export of ballistic missiles for Russian use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transport of North Korean missiles is the latest expansion of the country\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s military aggression toward Ukraine. The first reports of North Korean arms shipments to Russia came out back in late 2022. A year later, in October 2023, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby revealed that North Korea had delivered over 1,000 canisters of weaponry and equipment to Russia. In late 2023, South Korean officials maintained North Korean military factories were operating at full force in an attempt to meet Russian demand for arms.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Russia Leadership Shakeup The new MinDef Belousov, is a technocrat without Defense experience, but nevertheless a competent and trusted manager, the author writes.\n\nIt is not known what Russia is trading in exchange for North Korean weapons, although rumors claim the Kremlin is providing the sanctioned nation with access to newly developed military technologies. It has been reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited several military sites displaying advanced military systems during a September 2023 trip to Russia.\n\nUnfortunately, North Korea has been joined in stocking Vladimir Putin with an arsenal for attacking Ukraine by a second autocratic regime. Iran has furnished Russia with vast numbers of attack drones and artillery shells with Russia also gaining use of Iran\u2019s drone technologies to institute extensive domestic production of attack drones to utilize against Ukraine. Reports in the New Year show this collaboration is strengthening with Russia set to receive upgraded drones along with Iranian ballistic missiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian war effort two years into its invasion of Ukraine has come to be dependent on the military backing it is getting from North Korea and Iran. Whereas Putin has transferred much of Russia\u2019s economy into war mode, the duration and vigor of the fighting in Ukraine demonstrates that Moscow is presently not able to meet the high demand for specific munitions classes like drones, missiles and artillery shells.\n\nCurrently in year three of the full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, North Korea and Iran\u2019s ammunition deliveries are allowing Russia to preserve a notable heavy weapons advantage in a battle now described as a war of attrition. Additionally, the constant supply of Iranian drones allows Russia to pursue its intense bombing crusade against Ukrainian cities and the country\u2019s civilian infrastructure. Ballistic missiles obtained from North Korea and Iran will permit Russia to continue expanding the air war against Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Putin\u2019s fellow cohorts in Pyongyang and Tehran become braver in their willingness to subsidize Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, the West\u2019s group allegiance to the Ukrainian side has become questionable. In the US, the recently passed aid package for Ukraine saw a six-month delay thanks to domestic political haggling. This development is raising questions about the future of the West\u2019s support for Ukraine in a drawn-out conflict with Russia.\n\nRecent indicators of Western frailty are encouraging to Putin, who believes he can withstand Ukraine\u2019s Western allies in a test of political fortitude. His historical endgame of invading Ukraine has always been a venture to put an end to Western dominance and initiate a new world order. Forming alliances with congenial autocratic regimes is a major step toward achieving such a goal.\n\nThere is little doubt that Russia has successfully instituted a partnership in arms together with North Korea and Iran. The three autocratic countries are capitalizing on their military capability and manufacturing large quantities of weapons required to thwart resistance from the West and attain a Russian victory in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis union of authoritarians constitutes a severe threat to the future of the world\u2019s security. Should Russia triumph in Ukraine with the help of military backing from North Korea and Iran, Ukrainians will not be the only victims. A Putin victory could set off a catastrophic paradigm. The global community could easily be confronted by more wars of aggression, with the world plunging into a perilous new age where today\u2019s regulations with regard to national sovereignty and territorial integrity would no longer be applicable.\n\nThis is not yet a reality, but time is of the essence. To avoid decades of international apprehension and uncertainty, Western leaders have to send an unequivocal message to all autocrats and Putin copycats by ensuring Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine culminates in a momentous defeat.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are the author\u2019s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.",

        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nOn Tuesday, Vladimir Putin was inaugurated for another six-year term as president amid the worst crisis in Moscow\u2019s relations with the West over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. During the traditionally ornate ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin called his compatriots a \"united and great nation\" and vowed to place Russia\u2019s interests and security above anything else. Brimming with confidence, the Russian strongman punctuated his speech by declaring: \"Together we will overcome all obstacles. We will fulfill everything we have planned. Together we will win.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the top U.S. spy chief, DNI Avril Haines, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the Russia-Ukraine war is \"unlikely to end anytime soon,\" warning that Putin\u2019s \"aggressive tactics are likely to continue.\" That, despite the fact that Congress recently approved another multibillion-dollar military aid package for Ukraine to help it fight the Russians.\n\nWhat is inside Putin\u2019s mind at this time? Will the Russian dictator be deterred by our government\u2019s unwavering commitment to fund Kyiv? What are his next steps?\n\nAS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN SOVIET RUSSIA, DON'T LET AMERICA TURN INTO A GODLESS NATION\n\nHaving examined Russia\u2019s force posture, the state of the Russian military and economy, declared strategic goals and threat perceptions, here is what we can expect from Putin, whose thinking I\u2019ve studied and analyzed in the course of my intelligence career. I will also note what Putin will probably not do.\n\nFirst, the Russian forces will highly likely initiate a major counteroffensive campaign in northeastern Ukraine. It's possible that it could begin right after the Victory Day Parade, the national holiday celebrating Russia\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Aiming to capitalize on Ukraine\u2019s shortages in manpower, combat hardware and ammunition, the Russians will seek to break through the front lines by or during this summer.\n\nTo make this happen, Moscow is preparing 100,000 troops to join the front lines, consistent with the decree signed by Putin in December directing the Ministry of Defense to increase the armed forces by 170,000 additional personnel to the maximum strength of 1,320,000 servicemen. Moscow is also increasing its defense spending by almost 70% in 2024 from 2023.\n\nPutin feels that the momentum is on Russia\u2019s side theater wide, as Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned. This being said, he is almost certainly deeply concerned about a recent statement made by French President Emmanuel Macron to The Economist. Macron insinuated that he would send troops to Ukraine \"if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request.\"\n\nAiming to deter NATO from deploying forces into the theater, Russia will hold military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons. Putin personally ordered the drills to \"practice for the preparation and deployment for use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" according to Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense.\n\nWhile Russia routinely conducts strategic nuclear exercises, announcing them in advance, the public declaration made by Moscow of non-strategic nuclear drills is unprecedented. It is intended as a strategic signaling to leaders in Washington and NATO commanders to stay out of what Russia considers its strategic security perimeter, of which Ukraine is part in Moscow\u2019s view.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s inauguration speech, Putin \u2013 almost certainly referring to Ukrainians living in the regions annexed by Moscow \u2013 thanked the \"citizens of Russia in all regions of our country, residents of our historical lands who defended the right to be together with the Motherland.\" Putin believes that Russia has a rightful claim to Ukraine its statehood originated from \"Kievan Rus,\" the land that is currently occupied by modern Ukraine.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of Russians support the actions of its military in Ukraine, effectively agreeing with Putin, according to the Levada Center. The same percentage of Russians believe that Russia will win the war. Levada is an independent polling agency designated by the Russian state as a \"foreign agent\" for expressing views that are unfavorable to the Russian government.\n\nIS RUSSIA\u2019S PUTIN A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN OR HAS HE WEAPONIZED RELIGION TO ADVANCE HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS?\n\nSecond, Russian intelligence services will likely ramp up their hunt for Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an attempt to assassinate him. On Saturday, the Russian government added Zelenskyy to the list of wanted criminals. The Russian Interior Ministry justified the search warrant for the Ukrainian president by stating that is \"under an article of the criminal code.\"\n\nZelenskyy has been on the target list since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022 and has survived multiple assassination attempts. A day before Putin\u2019s inauguration, Ukraine\u2019s counterintelligence services reportedly disrupted a Russian covert operation aimed at infiltrating Zelenskyy\u2019s security team and taking him hostage or killing him.\n\nRussia has a targeted assassination program governed by the federal law, \"On Countering Extreme Activity,\" that was approved by Putin in 2002, two-and-a-half years after he assumed the presidency, and updated in 2006. This law already allows Russian intelligence services to \"eliminate (likvidirovat) Zelenskyy and other military and political leaders of Ukraine as \u2018persons presenting a threat to the Russian state.\u2019\"\n\nPlacing Zelenskyy on the \"wanted list\" sends a signal to Russian security services that capturing or killing him is a priority for the Kremlin.\n\nThe Russians will likely intensify their efforts to eliminate Zelenskyy on or after May 20, the day when his presidential term officially ends. Last November, Zelenskyy canceled the 2024 presidential election, arguing that Ukraine must concentrate all its resources on fighting Russia, which prompted Moscow to consider him illegitimate as the leader of Ukraine.\n\nThird, Russia will intensify its non-kinetic confrontation with Washington. While Russia fears a direct war with the U.S. and NATO, because of our superiority in conventional arms, it views the risk of the erosion of its strategic buffer zone, on which it relied for its security for centuries, even more. Washington\u2019s continuous support provided to Ukraine has exacerbated Russia\u2019s fears of a future conflict with NATO.\n\nMoscow believes a direct kinetic U.S.-Russia war is \"inevitable\" in the long run. The Russian General Staff made this intelligence assessment based on the long-standing U.S. policy seeking to democratize Russia\u2019s post-Soviet neighbors in Eurasia and Washington\u2019s stated intentions to accept Ukraine into NATO, an adversarial alliance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLast week, four Russian military aircraft breached the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), but didn\u2019t enter U.S. airspace, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Russia periodically flies strategic bombers close to our borders. These practice runs are intended to test our responses and to signal the readiness of the Russian military for a full-on war with the United States over control of the post-Soviet regions. Russian weapons systems are already capable of striking targets throughout the United States and Canada from stand-off distances \u2013 that is, without entering U.S. sovereign airspace to deliver the weapons.\n\nRussian intelligence services also will likely intensify their efforts to arrest U.S. citizens traveling to Russia in a effort to rattle the Biden administration and to accumulate a list of candidates to trade with Washington for high-value Russian operatives held in U.S. prisons. On Tuesday, a U.S. Army soldier was detained in Vladivostok on charges of theft. Having had a number of prisoner swaps that Putin almost certainly feels were favorable to Russia, Moscow likely concluded that it can manipulate the Biden administration into giving up Russian assets valuable to Putin.\n\nFinally, what Putin will not do is invade a NATO nation. Despite such claims made by Washington politicians, such a move would be suicidal for Putin as it would trigger NATO Article 5 Collective Defense. Putin is acutely aware of Russia\u2019s conventional inferiority visa-a-vis NATO.\n\nPutin routinely uses Russia\u2019s nuclear trump card to intimidate the West and would likely authorize a tactical nuclear strike in the theater such as in Ukraine in certain scenarios, but those are high on the escalation ladder. But, as a rational actor, he would not intentionally pick a fight in which Russia would face the might of NATO\u2019s entire war-fighting machine. Such a claim is illogical. It is also refuted by multiple assessments made by the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe 2024 Annual Threat assessment reveals that \"Russia almost certainly does not want a direct military conflict with U.S. and NATO forces and will continue asymmetric activity below what it calculates to be the threshold of military conflict globally.\"\n\nThe following excerpts from unclassified intelligence reports debunk the idea that Russia has the military and economic capacity to invade a NATO country, triggering a war with NATO: \"Russia has suffered more military losses than at any time since World War II \u2013 roughly 300,000 casualties and thousands of tanks and armored combat vehicles\" and \"Moscow's military forces will face a multi-year recovery after suffering extensive equipment and personnel losses during the Ukraine conflict.\"\n\nThe same report reveals that \"the Russian military has and will continue to face issues of attrition, personnel shortages, and morale challenges.\"",
