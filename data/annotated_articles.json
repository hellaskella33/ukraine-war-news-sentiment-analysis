        "content": "this century has one overarching theme: the fall of the west, that is, the us and its european allies. every major crisis accelerates the unmistakable trend. the war in gaza is just the latest manifestation. western newspapers are now littered with articles full of the panicked realisation that more is buried in the rubble of gaza than just thousands of unidentified bodies. \u201cthe damage to israel\u2019s reputation,\u201d writes matthew parris in the times, \u201cso much less manifest than shattered hospitals in gaza, is incalculable.\u201d yes, but it would be an error to believe that it is israel\u2019s problem alone. when the former palestinian negotiator diana buttu told me this was an \u201cisraeli-american attack\u201d, she summed up what much of the world sees. that israel faces a catastrophic strategic defeat and reputational calamity is dawning on even its most ardent supporters; soon it will be widely understood that this applies to its western cheerleaders, too.\n\nthe west\u2019s decline long predates this current crime of historic proportions, but it is the radical right which has, to date, monopolised this conversation. for it, the explanations for the downfall are, variously, immigration, multiculturalism, islam, \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cgender ideology\u201d, the disintegration of the nuclear family, and so on. liz truss\u2019s forthcoming book, ten years to save the west, raging against a supposedly leftwing establishment blocking free-market innovation, is the latest addition to this genre. in fact, the explanation is really rather simple. in the aftermath of the soviet collapse more than 30 years ago, western elites became intoxicated with a premature triumphalism. the hubris of the us neoconservative midge decter, speaking after the collapse of the berlin wall, sums it up well. \u201cit\u2019s time to say: we\u2019ve won. goodbye,\u201d she stated grandly.\n\ntwo conclusions were drawn from this perceived victory. one, that the model of unchained capitalism that had become dominant in the 1980s was the unimprovable end stage of human existence, boldly summed up by the us political scientist francis fukuyama\u2019s book the end of history and the last man. two, that the us and its allies now had unchecked power and could behave as the world\u2019s police service. this was hubris, and inevitably, as anyone familiar with greek tragedy knows, nemesis followed in its wake.\n\nresearch by brown university suggests that about 4.5 million people died as a result of the post-9/11 wars\n\nthe global power of the us had taken a severe hit in the 1970s, when its standing was weakened by the humiliating sight of panicked us officials clambering on to helicopters in saigon, sealing a final defeat in vietnam. but its main rival, the soviet union, proved to be in a far more parlous state, and its collapse offered the west a chance to resurrect itself, with the first gulf war and armed interventions in former yugoslavia offered up as vindication for \u201cliberal interventionism\u201d. then came the horror of 9/11 \u2013 and the ensuing military adventures that resulted in human catastrophe as well as humiliating failure. war in afghanistan descended into a bloody quagmire, with the taliban ending the drawn-out conflict more dominant than they had been at the start. the invasion of iraq would \u201copen the gates of hell\u201d in the middle east, warned the arab league secretary-general amr moussa \u2013 and so it proved. nato intervention in libya\u2019s civil war ended in \u201cvictory\u201d, as gaddafi was toppled. but at what cost? libya is now a war-ravaged failed state.\n\nit isn\u2019t just western military invincibility that has been shattered by these various escapades. the contempt shown for international law set a precedent other states knew they could follow, encouraging global disorder. research by brown university suggests that about 4.5 million people died as a result of the post-9/11 wars. the mass death these ventures brought about, and the accompanying human rights abuses typified by guant\u00e1namo and abu ghraib, have ignited a justified contempt for western claims to moral superiority. some, like vladimir putin, have sought to use this contempt as ammunition for their own aggression.\n\nas well as its role in supporting israel\u2019s massacre in gaza, the west must reflect on how it fostered the conditions in which a putin-like figure could emerge in russia. the putin regime, of course, bears responsibility for russia\u2019s hideous invasion of ukraine: the us isn\u2019t the only powerful state capable of violence and destruction. but is there not more to the story? does the neoliberal economic model that western states exported to russia not share some of the blame? that putinism exploited russian despair after the cold war is incontrovertible; but so is the fact that western states promoted \u201ceconomic shock therapy\u201d. this triggered a more severe crisis than the great depression, roaring hyperinflation, a drastic fall in life expectancy, and oligarchs pilfering the nation\u2019s wealth. could a more stable, post-soviet russia have been inured from the revanchism of an authoritarian like putin?\n\nthis disastrous economic model not only destabilised russia, but paid untold damage to western, liberal democracies too. such unrestrained capitalism directly paved the way for the 2008 financial crash, from which the west never truly recovered. many of its countries then embarked on a ruinous course of austerity, which led to stagnation and decline, the ideal conditions for a rightwing authoritarian surge. the subsequent rise of donald trump\u2019s far-right movement now imperils the very future of us democracy. everywhere, liberal democracy is in retreat, increasingly replaced by autocratic regimes such as in hungary, which the european union occasionally wrings its hands over but with little action to back it up. in most european countries the far right is surging, a worrying omen of the continent\u2019s future.\n\nthe triumphalism of western elites after the fall of the berlin wall was misplaced. over three decades on, their hubris has proved disastrous, their wars and economic doctrine bringing blood, chaos and decline. gaza is just the bloody culmination of the west\u2019s loss of legitimacy. much of the world already had disdain for its moral claims, but there is no turning back this time. the moral collapse is now complete, as much of the middle east and beyond brims with contempt for israel\u2019s protectors.\n\nthings could have been different. there could have been accountability over previous foreign debacles: instead those responsible \u2013 from government ministers to hawkish newspaper commentators \u2013 walked from disaster to disaster, splattered with more and more blood, yet continued in their roles with their careers and reputations somehow intact. meanwhile, rather than being treated with the respect those with insight deserve, the people who opposed these calamities at the time remain ostracised as fringe extremists or dupes of foreign enemies, despite being repeatedly vindicated.\n\njust as we could have built an economic model that doesn\u2019t hoover up wealth into the bank accounts of the tiny elite, the lessons of the west\u2019s disastrous foreign policy history could have been heeded, and thus its catastrophic backing of israel\u2019s gaza assault avoided. alas, it was not to be. you may have found these last years of turmoil exhausting. buckle up: the fall of the west has several more acts to come.\n\nowen jones is a guardian columnist\n\ndo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

he started wearing a cossack caftan and grew a beard.\n\nin mid-september, when napoleon\u2019s army was preparing to enter moscow, davydov surprised a large detachment of french foragers in the rear of the french army near the village of tsaryovo-zaymishche and routed them. \u201cfear has large eyes and fear is inseparable from disorder. everything crumbled as soon as we turned up: we captured some of them not only without their weapons, but even without their clothes; some were dragged out of the barns; only one rabble of thirty took it into their heads to defend themselves, but they were scattered and taken down on the spot. as a result of the raid, we ended up with 119 common soldiers, two officers, 10 wagons with provisions and one wagon with cartridges,\u201d davydov wrote in \u2018diary of guerrilla operations\u2019.\n\non november 7, denis davydov\u2019s detachment, along with other \u201cflying detachments\u201d, smashed a brigade commanded by gen. jean-pierre augereau in a battle near the village of lyakhovo. the general himself and one-and-a-half thousand of his soldiers were taken prisoner by the russians. \u201cthis victory was all the more notable in that, for the first time in the prosecution of the present campaign, an enemy corps laid down its arms to us,\u201d was how general-field marshal mikhail kutuzov, the commander-in-chief of the russian army, commented on the triumph.\n\nwith the russian army\u2019s crossing of the borders of the russian empire in january 1813 and the start of its foreign campaign, davydov\u2019s daring cavalry raids in the rear of the enemy, by and large, came to an end. he began to operate more in conjunction with the main body of troops and was now in their advance guard.\n\nafter the end of the war against napoleon, denis vasilyevich spent another 20 years or so serving in the military. aside from the army, his other great passion was poetry and he went down in history as the \u201cpartisan poet\u201d.\n\nkonstantin chekhovich\n\npublic domain public domain\n\nat precisely eight o\u2019clock in the evening on november 13, 1943, a powerful explosion rocked a cinema in the town of porkhov in pskov region. it killed more than 700 wehrmacht soldiers, 40 officers and two generals. the organizer and perpetrator of this massive act of sabotage was the cinema manager, who was additionally an active fighter of the 7th leningrad partisan brigade. his name was konstantin chekhovich.\n\nat the very beginning of the war, konstantin alexandrovich, the commander of a sapper platoon, was sent to the leningrad area, where he was to carry out sabotage operations. here he ended up in german captivity, from which he managed to escape after just two weeks. it was then that chekhovich joined the partisans. intending fully to utilize chekhovich\u2019s professional skills, the command of the 7th leningrad partisan brigade sent him to the town of porkhov for a major sabotage operation.\n\nkonstantin alexandrovich spent two years blending in with the locals in the town and gaining the confidence of the germans: he became a family man and worked as a clock repairer and then as an electrician at the local power station. after getting a job at the cinema as a mechanic, he was subsequently promoted to manager.\n\nthe porkhov cinema was chosen by the command of the partisan brigade as the main target of the operation. while german servicemen would gather on the ground floor to watch films, a branch of the german security service (sd) was located on the first floor.\n\nusing his pockets and a small lunch bag, chekhovich gradually smuggled 65 kg of tnt into the cinema premises, skilfully planting it around the perimeter of the building and installing a timer. his wife\u2019s sister evgeniya mikhaylova, who worked as a cleaner here, assisted him greatly in this.\n\nthe sabotage expert had calculated everything well: the blast came at the appointed time and the cinema building collapsed like a house of cards, burying under the debris the german servicemen who had gathered for the last film show of their lives. both konstantin alexandrovich and his family were gone from the town by then.\n\nfor carrying out his mission, chekhovich was put forward for the hero of the soviet union title, but it was never awarded - his two-week period in german captivity was a factor. only in 2013 was a commemorative plaque to him unveiled in the town of porkhov.\n\nsidor kovpak\n\npublic domain public domain\n\nwhen the german army invaded the soviet union, sidor artemyevich kovpak had already turned 54. the last time he had wielded a weapon was during the civil war and, in the intervening years, he had been mainly involved in civilian work. but this did not prevent him from becoming one of the most effective soviet partisan commanders and principal organizers of the partisan movement in ukraine in world war ii.\n\nin september 1941, kovpak became leader of a small partisan detachment numbering scarcely more than ten men, hiding in the spadshchansky forest near the town of putivl in northeast ukraine. \u201cour first dugout was built in such dense undergrowth that from a few dozen paces away you might not even find it. if you sat still there no german sniffer dog would ferret you out of that lair. but we hadn\u2019t gone to the woods to hide from the germans, but to kill them, to give them not a moment\u2019s peace and to prevent them from playing the master in our own district. we were the masters here and we were intent on remaining the masters,\u201d he wrote in his memoirs titled \u2018from putivl to the carpathians\u2019.\n\nwithin a mere half-year, kovpak\u2019s putivl detachment had evolved into the sumy partisan unit numbering around 1,500 fighters. the partisans under his command carried out daring raids to the rear of german and hungarian troops, while contriving to extricate themselves from the most formidable traps set by the punitive forces sent out to catch them.\n\nin the summer of 1943, kovpak\u2019s unit was instructed to mount a large-scale raid on western ukrainian territory, which was subsequently to become widely known as the carpathian raid. over a three-month period the partisans covered a distance of 2,000 km in the rear of the enemy, smashing up to 17 german garrisons, derailing 19 trains, destroying 51 depots and 52 bridges and also putting a number of power stations and oil fields out of action.\n\n\u201cour arrival at the approaches to the dniester was so unexpected to the germans that they mistook the partisans for assault forces dropped by parachute. detachments of gendarmerie began to rush around the roads. one such detachment ran into us near the town of skalat. we had stopped here for a day\u2019s rest at the side of a wood. deciding that they were dealing with a small detachment of soviet paratroopers, the german gendarmes deployed in extended order and mounted a \u2018human wave\u2019 attack against the partisan formation which actually numbered around 2,000 fighters. we allowed those goons to approach so close that we were able to have a laugh as the expression on their faces instantly changed when the entire edge of the wood suddenly came to life and a tidal wave of partisans advanced to confront the enemy\u2026 the gendarmes got blown away in a split second,\u201d kovpak recalled.\n\nin late 1943, sidor artemyevich was forced by illness to hand over command to his deputy, pyotr vershigora, and to withdraw to territory controlled by the red army. in honor of its former commander, the sumy partisan unit was soon afterwards renamed the 1st ukrainian partisan division named after twice hero of the soviet union s.a. kovpak.\n\nif using any of russia beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material.",

and other weaponry for use in its war against ukraine, according to a u.s. assessment.\n\ntwo senior biden administration officials, who discussed the sensitive findings friday on the condition of anonymity, said that in 2023 about 90% of russia\u2019s microelectronics came from china, which russia has used to make missiles, tanks and aircraft. nearly 70% of russia\u2019s approximately $900 million in machine tool imports in the last quarter of 2023 came from china.\n\nus house foreign affairs committee head says partnership between china, russia is greatest threat since wwii\n\nchinese and russian entities have also been working to jointly produce unmanned aerial vehicles inside russia, and chinese companies are likely providing russia with nitrocellulose used in the manufacture of ammunition, the officials said. china-based companies wuhan global sensor technology co., wuhan tongsheng technology co. ltd. and hikvision are providing optical components for use in russian tanks and armored vehicles.\n\nthe officials said russia has received military optics for use in tanks and armored vehicles manufactured by chinese firms iray technology and north china research institute of electro-optics, and china has been providing russia with uav engines and turbojet engines for cruise missiles.\n\nrussia\u2019s semiconductor imports from china jumped from $200 million in 2021 to over $500 million in 2022, according to russian customs data analyzed by the free russia foundation, a group that advocates for civil society development.\n\nbeijing is also working with russia to improve its satellite and other space-based capabilities for use in ukraine, a development the officials say could in the longer term increase the threat russia poses across europe. the officials, citing downgraded intelligence findings, said the u.s. has also determined that china is providing imagery to russia for its war on ukraine.\n\nthe officials discussed the findings as secretary of state antony blinken is expected to travel to china this month for talks. blinken is scheduled to travel next week to the group of 7 foreign ministers meeting in capri, italy, where he's expected to raise concerns about china's growing indirect support for russia as moscow revamps its military and looks to consolidate recent gains in ukraine.\n\npresident joe biden has previously raised his concerns directly with chinese president xi jinping about beijing indirectly supporting russia\u2019s war effort.\n\nwhile china has not provided direct lethal military support for russia, it has backed it diplomatically in blaming the west for provoking russian president vladimir putin\u2019s decision to launch the war and refrained from calling it an invasion in deference to the kremlin.\n\nchina has repeatedly said it isn\u2019t providing russia with arms or military assistance, although it has maintained robust economic connections with moscow, alongside india and other countries, amid sanctions from washington and its allies.\n\n\"the normal trade between china and russia should not be interfered or restricted,\" said liu pengyu, spokesman of the chinese embassy in washington. \"we urge the u.s. side to refrain from disparaging and scapegoating the normal relationship between china and russia.\"\n\nxi met in beijing on tuesday with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov, who heaped praise on xi's leadership.\n\nrussia\u2019s growing economic and diplomatic isolation has made it increasingly reliant on china, its former rival for leadership of the communist bloc during the cold war.\n\ntreasury secretary janet yellen, who returned to washington this week from a visit to beijing, said she warned chinese officials that the biden administration was prepared to sanction chinese banks, companies and beijing\u2019s leadership, if they assist russia\u2019s armed forces with its ongoing invasion of ukraine.\n\nthe democratic president issued an executive order in december giving yellen the authority to sanction financial institutions that aided russia\u2019s military-industrial complex.\n\n\"we continue to be concerned about the role that any firms, including those in the prc, are playing in russia\u2019s military procurement,\" yellen told reporters, using the initials for the people's republic of china. \"i stressed that companies, including those in the prc, must not provide material support for russia\u2019s war and that they will face significant consequences if they do. and i reinforced that any banks that facilitate significant transactions that channel military or dual-use goods to russia\u2019s defense industrial base expose themselves to the risk of u.s. sanctions.\"\n\nthe u.s. has frequently downgraded and unveiled intelligence findings about russia\u2019s plans and operations over the course of the more than 2-year-old war with ukraine.\n\nsuch efforts have been focused on highlighting plans for russian misinformation operations or to throw attention on moscow\u2019s difficulties in prosecuting its war against ukraine as well as its coordination with iran and north korea to supply it with badly needed weaponry. blinken last year spotlighted intelligence that showed china was considering providing arms and ammunition to russia.\n\nthe white house believes that the public airing of the intelligence findings has led china, at least for now, to hold off on directly arming russia. china's economy has also been slow to emerge from the covid-19 pandemic. chinese officials could be sensitive to reaction from european capitals, which have maintained closer ties to beijing even as the u.s.-china relationship has become more complicated.\n\nmeanwhile, china on thursday announced rare sanctions against two u.s. defense companies over what it called their support for arms sales to taiwan, the self-governing island democracy beijing claims as its own territory to be recovered by force if necessary.\n\nthe announcement freezes the assets of general atomics aeronautical systems and general dynamics land systems held within china. it also bars the companies\u2019 management from entering the country.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nfilings show general dynamics operates a half-dozen gulfstream and jet aviation services operations in china, which remains heavily

        "content": "during the full-scale invasion, russian troops have damaged or wholly destroyed at least 630 churches, prayer houses, and other religious facilities in ukraine.\n\nthe institute for religious freedom published this new data in the report \u201cthe impact of the russian invasion on faith-based communities in ukraine.\u201d the irf research contains the results of monitoring and surveys on the situation of ukrainian religious communities in the territories occupied by russia.\n\nthe report in english\n\nthe summary of the report in english\n\nthe report in ukrainian\n\nin addition, irf recorded seventeen interviews with religious leaders of various denominations about russian war crimes in ukraine. these video testimonies are available for watching on youtube with english subtitles.\n\nthe kremlin uses religion, particularly russian religious centers, as a tool of war against ukraine. in addition to propagating hatred of ukrainians, the russian authorities in the occupied territories of ukraine often practice arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, torture, and even murder of ukrainian religious leaders. those priests, pastors, imams, etc., who did not agree to collaborate and refused to submit to russian religious centers are subject to repression.\n\nadvertisement\n\nthe irf report states that most damage was inflicted by russian missiles, kamikaze drones, and artillery, including targeted attacks on civilian objects. in addition, some places of worship have been deliberately looted by the russian military, closed, or converted by the occupying authorities into administrative buildings.\n\nother topics of interest russian offensive begins in kharkiv region an unnamed senior ukrainian military source revealed that russian forces aim to push ukrainian troops back up to 10 km to establish a buffer zone, but kyiv\u2019s forces are resisting.\n\nmost churches, prayer houses, synagogues, and mosques were destroyed in donetsk region (at least 146), luhansk region (at least 83), and kherson region (at least 78). the destruction in kyiv region, where russian troops attempted to capture the capital of ukraine in february-march 2022, was also enormous (73). due to the ongoing hostilities, the number of destroyed buildings is increasing in kharkiv region (at least 62), zaporizhzhia region (at least 51), and mykolaiv region (at least 41).\n\nadvertisement\n\ninfographics: irf ukraine / irf.in.ua\n\non a confessional basis, orthodox churches suffered most damage from the russian aggression \u2013 at least 246 in total. of these, the churches of the ukrainian orthodox church (affiliated with the moscow patriarchate) suffered the most \u2013 at least 187. also, 59 churches of the orthodox church of ukraine were destroyed or damaged.\n\nthe scale of destruction and looting of evangelical churches is also extensive \u2013 at least 206 in total. among them, the pentecostal (94), baptist (60), and seventh-day adventist church (27) prayer houses suffered the most.\n\nit is most likely that if russia retains control over the occupied territories of zaporizhzhia and kherson regions throughout 2024 and beyond, ukrainian churches and religious communities in these regions will face the same fate as believers in the parts of donetsk and luhansk regions occupied since 2014. the russian occupying authorities will continue to fight any manifestations of dissent, opposition, and ukrainian identity, particularly religious identity, by enforcing repressive russian legislation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nhiding behind slogans of protecting russian speakers, \u201cdenazification,\u201d and \u201cdesatanization\u201d of ukraine, the kremlin has actually been implementing the ideology of the \u201crusskiy mir\u201d (russian world). as interpreted by russian propagandists, this ideology comprises the physical destruction of the ukrainian people as a nation (genocide), the elimination of ukrainian cultural heritage, the overthrow of the ukrainian government, and the disappearance of the ukrainian state.\n\nrecommendations\n\nthe irf formulated several recommendations in the report. among them are the following:\n\nto publicly condemn the russian world ideology and the position of the russian orthodox church and patriarch kirill of moscow, as well as other russian religious associations and leaders who participate in the russian aggression and justify it or promote hatred and genocide of the people of ukraine.\n\nto strongly and proactively support ukraine\u2019s efforts to investigate russian war crimes and prosecute all war criminals.\n\nto introduce personal sanctions against russian officials, religious leaders, media workers, and other individuals responsible for justifying or carrying out repressions against ukrainian religious leaders and faith-based communities on the ukrainian territories controlled by russia.\n\nadvertisement\n\nto designate the russian federation as a state sponsor of terrorism, considering the constant attacks on the civilian population and critical infrastructure of ukraine, deliberate exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis, nuclear blackmail, the use of torture, inhuman treatment of prisoners of war, and arbitrarily imprisoned civilians, particularly religious figures.\n\nsee the original report by hrwf here.",

        "content": "the news that serbia sent ukraine financial aid to the tune of $32.4 million in march did not provoke much interest in either country. several ukrainian portals reported this confirmation from the ukrainian ministry of finance, pointing out how it was \u201cnoteworthy\u201d that the aid came from a country that i) maintains economic ties with russia; and ii) did not join the eu's economic sanctions against moscow.\n\nis this friendly transaction between two governments worthy of greater media attention? it is certainly worthy of examining further to mitigate the issue of stereotyping.\n\nthe latest financial support for ukraine is no small amount for serbia. it is equal to the annual budget of one of its medium-sized cities, with about 60,000 inhabitants. it is also not unprecedented. serbia in fact provided \u20ac3 million to ukraine to help vulnerable children and another \u20ac1.5 million to displaced persons, just a few months after russia launched its full-scale invasion of ukraine in 2022. along with financial aid, serbia sent material aid, medical vehicles, electric generators, water purification plants, and other humanitarian assistance to ukraine.\n\nadvertisement\n\nserbia is not part of the international coalition that supplies ukraine with weapons and military materials. it has proclaimed neutrality in relation to the conflict, and its authorities repeat that serbia does not supply weapons to any parties. however, there are convincing reports that serbia still delivers weapons to ukraine without interfering with the deliveries made through intermediary countries.\n\nother topics of interest official responsible for ukraine\u2019s national recovery removed lawmakers in ukraine\u2019s parliament have removed oleksandr kubrakov, one of several deputy prime ministers charged with overseeing national reconstruction.\n\na year ago, reuters published extracts from classified pentagon documents, according to which serbia agreed to supply arms to kyiv or has sent them already. in the meantime, videos began to appear sporadically on (primarily russian) social media accounts, mostly of artillery ammunition with labels of serbian manufacturers allegedly used by the armed forces of ukraine.\n\npolitical support\n\nhowever, serbia's most convincing support for ukraine's defense against russian aggression \u2013 and often overlooked \u2013 is at the political level. this may surprise those who continue to label or stereotype serbia as russia's ally and therefore ukraine's adversary.\n\nadvertisement\n\nsince the first resolution of the un general assembly in march 2022, serbia has consistently been among those countries that have condemned russian aggression and demanded its immediate withdrawal from ukraine. serbia voted for four such resolutions in the un, including the one condemning russia's annexation of four eastern regions of ukraine in october 2022. it was a big surprise to many too that serbia in fact voted for the exclusion of russia from the un human rights council in april 2022.\n\nserbia\u2019s position in global forums regarding the russian invasion of ukraine is identical to the one it takes in regional organizations. together with nine other countries in southeast europe, serbia signed a declaration according to which russian aggression against ukraine was a flagrant violation of international law and the greatest threat to european security. then, at a february summit in tirana with president volodymyr zelensky, the leaders of the region pledged to continue supporting ukraine until its victory.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201ci don't understand people [in serbia] who express anti-ukraine sentiments. i understand their position on russia. ukraine has never done anything against serbia. they are our slavic brothers and we try to have good relations,\u201d said serbian president aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107, one of the signatories of the regional declaration, in tirana at the time.\n\nhis meetings with zelensky have been frequent in the last year, and both consider them significant and friendly.\n\n\u201ci noted the importance of serbia's participation in the implementation of the peace formula,\u201d zelensky stated after their meeting in february, thanking serbia for its support of ukrainian sovereignty, the aid it provided, and the acceptance of ukrainian refugees.\n\nserbia did not impose economic sanctions on russia. when it took that decision at the very start of russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of ukraine, it pointed out that it could change that decision when it affected its economic and political interests. however, the issue of sanctions has been at the center of the usual portrayal of serbian positioning in favor of russian aggression against ukraine for too long, with less justification.\n\nfor zelensky, it does not pose any problem to maintain constant and solid partnership communications with serbian leader vu\u010di\u0107. serbia's political, humanitarian, financial, and quite possibly military support for ukraine, is continuous and not at all symbolic. as such, it has long since put aside the fact that serbia has not imposed economic sanctions on russia.\n\nadvertisement\n\nrussia\u2019s take on serbia\u2019s position\n\nnot surprisingly, those who recognize the partnership and friendly essence of serbia's relationship with ukraine are in moscow. while the kremlin, in its official statements, continues to characterize vu\u010di\u0107 as the leader of a friendly nation and a representative of partnership policy towards russia (even though there were exceptions to this), its propaganda channels often attack him as an insincere partner, completely turned towards the west, and thus ukraine.\n\nin the latest such offensive review, russian media described vu\u010di\u0107's meeting with emmanuel macron in paris earlier this week as humiliating. \u201che came to paris to beg and did not have the strength to stand up to the head of the \u00e9lys\u00e9e palace,\u201d he russian gazette wrote about the serbian-french summit, conveying, in fact, the kremlin's sincere position about the serbian president, one that they usually do not state themselves but leave to their controlled media.\n\nthe problem for moscow is that the last of as many as 20 meetings between president vu\u010di\u0107 and macron will result in the purchase of 12 french rafale fighter jets, which represent serbia\u2019s final strategic shift away from the traditional attachment to russian weapons inherited from the soviet union and yugoslavia.\n\nadvertisement\n\nserbia and ukraine do not have any problems with their mutual relations. these relations are several levels higher than an ordinary partnership. most serbian citizens are on the side of russia on an emotional level, even when it invades the friendly people of ukraine. this is a factor that no serbian leader, not even vu\u010di\u0107, could ignore when creating policies regarding this conflict.\n\nbut only a brief overview of belgrade's official decisions regarding ukraine, including the financial package of $32.4 million from last march, clearly shows where serbia really stands.\n\nthe views expressed are the author\u2019s and not necessarily of kyiv post.",

        "content": "why, under paul i, were men not allowed to wear shoes with ribbons instead of bucklesand, under peter i, to walk in shoes lined with iron nails? and what do bears and cats have to do with it?\n\n1. do not wear shoes secured with nails\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\npeter the great, as you may know, was a great entrepreneur. and he even took care of such prosaic things as the wooden sidewalks of st. petersburg. to prevent them from wearing out quickly, in 1715, he issued a decree prohibiting walking in shoes lined with iron staples or nails. violators faced harsh punishment: desperate fashionistas - heavy fines, while sellers - hard labor and confiscation of property. the reaction was lightning-fast: the streets were suddenly empty.\n\nyear later, a new decree followed, which obliged all home owners in st. petersburg to pave a \u2018sazhen\u2019 (213 cm) of the street in front of them with stone.\n\n2. sew buttons on the cuffs of uniforms\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\npeter i also ordered buttons to be sewn on the cuffs of uniforms. the reason is simple: he wanted to teach the military good manners and discourage them from wiping their mouths with their sleeve after eating, so as to not have to sew a new uniform so often.\n\n3. drink no more than a glass\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\nin 1647, tsar alexei mikhailovich declared war on alcoholism - first he banned alcohol in the solovetsky monastery and, a couple of years later, in all other monasteries. four years after that, he carried out a pub reform: the tsar ordered the reduction of the number of drinking outlets. at the same time, prices for alcohol increased threefold: it was impossible to sell it on credit and no more than one glass per person was sold - about 150 milliliters. in addition, it was prohibited to trade during fasting and on sundays: in total, there were 180 of such \"sober\" days on the calendar! by the way, those who produced \u201cunderground\u201d vodka faced serious punishment: from fines for those who were caught for the first time, to whipping and prison for such malicious manufacturers of counterfeit goods.\n\n4. don\u2019t wear round hats or dance the waltz\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\nanother master of strange laws was paul i. he decided to fight everything that could be reminiscent of the french revolution and cause freethinking. the result was a decent list: women could not decorate their dresses with colored ribbons over the shoulder, men could only wear cocked and round hats, while wide-brimmed french hats were outlawed. and, along with them - shoes with ribbons instead of buckles, sideburns and even the waltz. rumors connected these wild prohibitions with the problems of the emperor himself: his beard did not grow very well and he was not a very agile dancer.\n\n5. do not export rhubarb\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\nin the 17th century, rhubarb was brought to moscow from china: it was used as a medicine for stomach disorders and as a dye that gave a golden hue. this herb was highly valued: a \u2018pood\u2019 (about 16 kg) cost 40 rubles! the same price as, for example, a \u2018pood\u2019 of good silk. it was forbidden to trade rhubarb: the main and only buyer and seller was the tsar's treasury. at the end of the 17th century, it could not be exported from siberia, under empresses anna ioanovna and elizabeth petrovna, rhubarb became a \"commodity for state profit\". \"siberian gold\" could not be bought by private individuals and the treasury kept very high prices on it. violators faced serious punishment, including \"the most severe torture\".\n\n6. wearing shaggy wigs\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\nsome decrees were born not out of economic or political considerations, but solely from a sense of beauty. for example, the empress elizabeth petrovna, a great fashionista, once used a poor-quality powder that tightly glued her hair together. coloring in black also did not help to hide the traces of an unsuccessful experiment. the empress almost completely cut her hair and began wearing a wig.\n\nand, at the same time, she ordered all the ladies of the court to do the same: they had to deprive themselves of their hair and wear black wigs, like her.\n\n7. send cats to the court\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\nin october 1745, empress elizabeth petrovna issued perhaps the sweetest decree - \u2018on the expulsion of cats\u2019. it said: \"having found the best and largest cats in kazan from the local breeds, suitable for catching mice, send them to st. petersburg to the court of her imperial majesty.\" since then, the rat-catching cats have settled in the winter palace.\n\n8. do not drive bears in the streets\n\nkira lisitskaya kira lisitskaya\n\nbear trade existed in russia for a long time: bears were taught various tricks and performed with them at fairs, to the admiration of the public. bears performed up to several dozens of different commands and staged entire performances, portraying a girl at a mirror, a soldier with a gun, a peasant who had gone on a bender and many others. in 1865, the society for the protection of animals appeared in russia, which began to save the bears. two years later, alexander ii signed a decree banning bear hunting.\n\ndear readers,\n\nour website and social media accounts are under threat of being restricted or banned, due to the current circumstances. so, to keep up with our latest content, simply do the following:\n\nsubscribe to our telegram channel\n\ntelegram channel subscribe to our weekly email newsletter\n\nweekly email newsletter enable push notifications on our website\n\nwebsite install a vpn service on your computer and/or phone to have access to our website, even if it is blocked in your country\n\nif using any of russia beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material.",

        "content": "capri, italy (ap) \u2014 top nato and european union officials urged foreign ministers from leading industrialized nations on thursday to take quick, concrete steps to provide more air defense systems and artillery to ukraine, warning that continued delays could tilt the war in moscow\u2019s favor.\n\nnato secretary general jens stoltenberg and eu foreign policy chief josep borrell addressed a meeting of foreign ministers of g7 nations meeting on the italian resort island of capri. russia\u2019s war on ukraine and surging tensions in the middle east over iran\u2019s unprecedented attack on israel over the weekend have topped the agenda of the gathering.\n\ntrump says us will '100%' stay in nato if alliance treats america 'fairly'\n\nwithout more patriot air defense missile systems to protect against russian strikes, \"the electricity system of ukraine will be destroyed. and no country can fight without having electricity at home, in the factories, in the front line,\" borrell told reporters on the sidelines of the event.\n\nstoltenberg welcomed signs that the u.s. congress might soon vote on a $61 billion aid package for ukraine, the bulk of which would go to purchasing weapons and ammunitions from u.s. defense manufacturers. and he welcomed other recent financial pledges from the netherlands and denmark as well as germany's recent announced delivery of a new patriot missile battery.\n\nbut he said more long-term and sustainable aid was necessary to better coordinate ukraine's response over the long term.\n\n\"there is an urgent, critical need for more air defense,\" stoltenberg said, adding that artillery rounds were also needed. \"we cannot continue to be in a situation where russia is outgunning ukraine, in the way they do now. the russians are shooting and shooting, and the ukrainians have limited resources to shoot back. so the ukrainians need more, and that\u2019s the urgent and important message from me to all allies.\"\n\nitalian foreign minister antonio tajani opened the first working session by calling for new sanctions against iran for its weekend attack and concrete help for ukraine. \"if ukraine loses, (russian president vladimir) putin will never sit at the peace table,\" tajani warned.\n\nthe capri meeting of the top diplomats from britain, canada, france, germany, italy, japan and the united states dovetailed with other regional diplomatic efforts sending the same messages. on wednesday, eu leaders meeting in brussels vowed to ramp up sanctions on iran to target its drone and missile deliveries to proxies in gaza, yemen and lebanon.\n\nthe u.s. and britain, meanwhile, announced thursday they were imposing a new round of sanctions on iran, with the u.s. targeting individuals and entities that produce engines that power drones and are involved in steel production. the latest british measures target several iranian military organizations, individuals and entities involved in iran\u2019s drone and ballistic missile industries.\n\nborrell said the existing eu sanctions regime would be strengthened and expanded to punish tehran and help prevent future attacks on israel. at the same time, he said, israel needed to exercise restraint.\n\n\"i don\u2019t want to exaggerate but we are on the edge of a war, a regional war in the middle east, which will be sending shockwaves to the rest of the world, and in particular to europe,\" he warned. \"so stop it.\"\n\ngerman foreign minister annalena baerbock said iran must be isolated \"because,of course, there must be a reaction to this unprecedented incident, but there must be no further escalation in the region,\" german news agency dpa reported.\n\non ukraine, its foreign minister dmytro kuleba, who was invited to capri as a guest, underlined his country\u2019s need for essential military support, including artillery, ammunition, and air defense systems as russia pushes along the front line.\n\nhe thanked germany for providing ukraine with a new patriot battery, which was announced over the weekend, but urged the u.s. congress to quickly approve the funding package.\n\n\"so we will work here at the ministerial level to make other allies deliver air defense systems to ukraine. because it\u2019s of fundamental importance,\" kuleba said.\n\npresident joe biden said wednesday he supported a proposal from the house speaker, mike johnson, to provide about $61 billion in aid for ukraine, signaling bipartisan support for the precarious funding bill.\n\nu.s. secretary of state antony blinken said he hoped the u.s. funding would come through but said other allies needed to step up.\n\n\"in this moment, it is urgent that all of the friends and supporters of ukraine maximize their efforts to provide ukraine with what it needs to continue to effectively defend itself against this russian aggression,\" blinken said after meeting with kuleba.\n\n\"if putin is allowed to proceed with impunity, we know he won\u2019t stop at ukraine and we can safely predict that his aggression will continue,\" blinken said. \"other would-be aggressors around the world will take note and unleash their own aggressions. and we will have a world of conflict, not a world of peace and security.\"\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nborrell said europe can't rely solely on washington to help ukraine defend itself.\n\n\"concrete decisions have to be taken in order to send to ukraine more air defense,\" he said. \"we do have patriots, we have anti-missile systems. we have to take them from the our barracks where they are just in case, and to send to ukraine where the war is raging. and i\u2019m sure we will be doing that, but it has to be done quickly.\"",

        "content": "the value of an effective air defence system and of unwavering international support was crystal clear the night of iran\u2019s massive attack on israel: most iranian missiles and drones were destroyed before they reached israeli soil. the us, the uk and france, as well as jordan, participated in israel\u2019s defence.\n\ni arrived in kyiv the following day. the contrast between the two emergencies could not be starker. unlike israel, ukraine lacks sufficient air defences, and the west provides far less than it could or should to defend ukraine against russia. ukraine is not dealing with one-off retaliation for striking a russian consulate \u2013 as israel is with iran. russia has been waging a war of aggression against ukraine since 2014, aimed at eradicating its nationhood.\n\ndaily, russian missiles and drones pummel ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure. a recent missile attack on a power generation plant in the north means that hundreds of thousands, if not a million more ukrainians could be forced to leave their homes by next winter. unable to occupy what is an unoccupiable country, russia has decided it wants to make ukrainian cities uninhabitable. already the numbers are horrifying: before russia\u2019s full-scale land invasion in 2022, ukraine had a population of around 40 million. today, just over 20 million live in free ukraine, and that number could decline further in the months ahead.\n\nrussia is also making headway along the frontline, outmatching ukraine in terms of artillery and manpower by a staggering 7:1 ratio, if not more. now that the us house of representatives has finally passed a long-awaited package of military aid worth $61bn for ukraine after months of stalling, it could hold the line, perhaps losing some more territory in the donetsk region. final sign-off for the bill by joe biden is expected within days. in the worst case scenario, 2024 could see the fall of other major cities and towns such as kharkiv, sumy or zaporizhzhia.\n\nmaking a state and a society function with a halved population, while fending off an invasion by one of the world\u2019s largest armies, requires unimaginable resilience. from what i could see over the course of a few days in the capital, kyiv bustles with life. but it is life punctuated by almost daily air-raid sirens.\n\nalong with a group from the berlin-based european council on foreign relations i was on the way to the train station one day when our app alerts went off. there was no bunker for us to take refuge in, but our taxi driver shrugged, unflustered. there was no point in panicking, he said, we would reach the station soon and perhaps it would be over by then anyway. he was right; no sooner had we reached the station than luke skywalker\u2019s voice on our app thundered: \u201cthe air alert is over, may the force be with you.\u201d\n\nfor ukrainians to keep believing the force is with them is hard enough. doing so with one hand tied behind their back because of insufficient western support is next to impossible.\n\nin some respects, the west is facing objective difficulty. it took europe and the us almost two years to wake up to the fact that this would be a long war and that delivering part of their old weapon stocks would be insufficient. for two years (and more), russia has put its economy on a war footing, while acquiring weapons from north korea and iran. the discrepancy in the ratios of artillery and ammunition are a reflection of this. belatedly, the realisation of a long war has dawned on the west, and arms production is being ramped up: by next year, european governments should be able to compensate for some of the current mismatch. this is why ukrainians perceive the coming months as their greatest window of vulnerability, perhaps greater than the first dramatic weeks after 24 february 2022.\n\nbut in other respects, european countries (and the us) have no excuses. paradoxically, while lacking enough basic artillery and ammunition, europe has no shortage of sophisticated air defence systems. there are approximately 100 such systems across europe collecting dust. important as the defence goal of deterring some future russian aggression may be, the european continent is already at war. if european air defence systems continue lying around rather than being provided to kyiv to save lives in ukraine, they may end up being needed where they are currently stationed, turning the reasons against their transfer to ukraine into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nukraine doesn\u2019t need 100 patriot and samp/t air defence systems; it just needs seven. but so far, with the exception of germany, european countries have balked. they have come up with all sorts of reasons (or excuses), including the need to respect nato standards. yet many don\u2019t seem to have the same concern for breaking nato standards on the target of 2% defence spending. if germany can agree to send an additional patriot battery to ukraine despite having resisted vigorously, other european countries can follow suit. not doing so now is simply unpardonable.\n\nit is worth asking ourselves what explains this western reticence on ukraine, especially given the stark contrast with the middle east. there are two possible answers, neither of which is edifying. the first and bluntest is fear. the west has been pulling its punches in the russia-ukraine war because it is scared of russia and russian escalation. the more it has manifested its fear, the more it has galvanised russia. vladimir putin smells fear, and like any fighter in a ring he is seizing the opportunity to double down. the ukraine war has become existential for the russian regime, and ukraine\u2019s window of vulnerability may not last for ever. therefore, best dig the knife in as deep as possible now that the west has immobilised itself in fear.\n\nthe second and most tragic reason is that europe does not yet regard ukraine as part of itself. as a colleague in kyiv put it: \u201ceurope still considers us its \u2018good other\u2019.\u201d so long as that othering persists, ukraine\u2019s existence will be in danger, and with it the security of the entire european continent. showing that ukraine is part of \u201cus\u201d means sending more of \u201cour\u201d air defences to protect ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. and it means approving ukraine\u2019s eu accession negotiations framework and holding the first intergovernmental conference opening ukraine\u2019s accession talks in june.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion sign up to this is europe free weekly newsletter the most pressing stories and debates for europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment enter your email address sign up privacy notice: newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. for more information see our newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. for more information see our privacy policy . we use google recaptcha to protect our website and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply. after newsletter promotion\n\nall this may seem bureaucratic and a low priority for a country struggling for its very survival. but insofar as it signals that europeans actually treat ukraine as part of europe, it is existential. a diplomat stationed in kyiv told us that when the eu moved to open accession negotiations with ukraine last december, soldiers on the frontline were jubilant. strange as it may seem, to them it was not an abstract idea but a tangible signal of belonging, of feeling they were not alone. and in this hour of greatest need, ukraine needs missiles and munitions as much as a heavy injection of morale. it\u2019s hard not to return from kyiv at the moment enriched, but with a heavy heart.\n\nnathalie tocci is a guardian europe columnist\n\ndo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? if you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "after months of delay, on tuesday, congress passed urgent aid for ukraine in its fight against russian aggression. but vladimir putin\u2019s expansionist aims do not end there. in moldova, wedged between an embattled ukraine and romania, russia\u2019s interference is only increasing. and without more western help, its foreign minister told me this week, this small european country could fall under moscow\u2019s control.\n\nmihai popsoi, moldova\u2019s 37-year-old newly minted top diplomat, was in washington to remind biden administration officials and lawmakers that the war in ukraine is not just about ukraine. since russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor two years ago, the 3 million residents of moldova have faced unprecedented instability and anxiety. putin is threatening moldova\u2019s security, squeezing its economy and undermining its democracy, efforts that are all aimed at replacing its pro-western leadership with a new government bought and paid for by the kremlin.\n\nkamyanets-podilskyi uman ukraine briceni soroca transnistria self-proclaimed republic since 1991 botosani balti ribnita dnister river moldova dubasari iasi chisinau

president maia sandu, struggles to fight off russian meddling and build ties with the west, it knows that its survival as a democracy is contingent on ukraine\u2019s survival, the foreign minister told me. the only thing standing between moldova (which has fewer than 10,000 personnel in its armed forces) and a russian attack is the ukrainian army.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cit\u2019s not an issue of whether russia wants to invade, it\u2019s only an issue of if they can,\u201d popsoi said. \u201cgod forbid, if the russians would feel emboldened, clearly moldova would be next. and after that, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nfor now, russia is waging hybrid warfare in moldova, whereby the kremlin is using all available means of leverage and interference to impose its will \u2014 short of bombing the country. moscow has tried to orchestrate a coup, trained fake anti-government protesters, flooded the country with disinformation and funneled illicit cash to pro-russian opposition parties.\n\njust last weekend, moscow hosted a conference for pro-russian moldovan opposition leaders, who announced a new election bloc ahead of moldova\u2019s october presidential elections. the main pro-russian party is led by israeli-born moldovan billionaire ilan shor, who was convicted in 2017 of stealing $1 billion from banks in his country. in 2022, the u.s. government imposed sanctions on shor for working with \u201ccorrupt oligarchs and moscow-based entities to create political unrest in moldova\u201d and undermine moldova\u2019s moves to join the european union.\n\nadvertisement\n\nmoldovans will also vote in october on whether to amend the country\u2019s constitution to enshrine its e.u. membership aspirations. this is what angers putin most of all, popsoi said. it\u2019s not lost on moldovans that russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of ukraine was sparked by kyiv\u2019s turn toward the e.u., and that putin tries to justify his 2022 invasion by pointing to ukraine\u2019s aspirations to join nato.\n\n\u201cthe russians are using our democratic process against us,\u201d popsoi said. \u201cthey are trying to install a pro-russian authoritarian regime that would mimic the russian model of government, to stab ukraine in the back.\u201d\n\nfollow this author josh rogin 's opinions follow\n\nthe internationally recognized territory of moldova includes two regions already with greater loyalty to moscow. russia has about 1,500 \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d troops in the autonomous region of transnistria, a strip of land along ukraine\u2019s western border, that it could activate as troublemakers at any time. and last year, moscow scored a success in its political incursions into moldova when its heavily supported candidate for governor of the autonomous region of gagauzia won, despite being virtually unknown before her candidacy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nmeanwhile, the western-leaning moldovan government has been moving to reduce dependence on russian energy and to thwart russian interference, with significant u.s. help. largely because of u.s. and european investment, moldova cut its dependence on russian gas and is now buying u.s.-supplied liquefied natural gas (at lower prices, by the way) through a new cooperative project with greece.\n\nbut there\u2019s a lot more the united states and its partners can and should do. president biden should show solidarity by inviting sandu to the white house. moldova needs more foreign investment in its infrastructure so it can become a hub for the future reconstruction of ukraine. it also needs help dealing with russia\u2019s advances in technology, such as deepfakes and other tools powered by artificial intelligence, which are amplifying the kremlin\u2019s disinformation campaigns.\n\n\u201cmoldova is a petri dish for russian hybrid warfare,\u201d popsoi said. \u201cand the tactics that we see being used in moldova, if the russians feel they are effective here, they are going to take them on the road.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nthere\u2019s a popular narrative in parts of the republican party that holds that ukraine can\u2019t win its war with russia, and that u.s. aid is only prolonging the conflict. this view, as espoused by sen. j.d. vance (ohio) and others, ignores the impact ukraine\u2019s defeat would have for its neighbors, the rest of the region \u2014 and the united states.\n\n\u201cputin\u2019s ambitions are imperial; he doesn\u2019t deny them. he wants to rebuild the soviet union,\u201d the foreign minister said. if russia isn\u2019t stopped in ukraine, \u201cthen all democracies are in trouble.\u201d",

four countries \u2014 china, russia, iran and north korea \u2014 but none of them pose a greater threat than china, according to the report.\n\n\"china has the capability to directly compete with the u.s. and u.s. allies and to alter the rules-based global order in ways that support beijing\u2019s power and form of governance over that of the u.s.,\" the report says.\n\nthere's concern that the

goals.\"\n\npresident xi jinping still sees taiwan as rightfully part of the people's republic of china. an always-looming potential invasion similar to russia's attack on ukraine is a \"flashpoint\"

\"almost certainly\" doesn't want any direct military conflict with the u.s. and nato forces, but there's still the threat of nuclear weapons and chemical warfare.\n\nrussia \"maintains the largest and most diverse nuclear weapons stockpile,\" including long-range capabilities and underwater delivery systems designed to penetrate or bypass u.s. missile defenses.\n\nthere have been at least two recent uses of chemical weapons in assassination attempts, in 2020 and in 2018.\n\nwatch putin tells the west: russia is ready for nuclear war\n\n3. immigration\n\nthe report details several countries being torn apart by domestic unrest, government corruption and economic discontent, which fuels cycles of insurrections and violence.\n\nsix countries' current situations are laid out in the report, including haiti, which descended into civil war led by warlord jimmy \"barbeque\" cherizier, and venezuela's government corruption.\n\nthe haitian government lost its grip on warring gangs, and the

like a dictator and will likely hold onto power. maduro's regime is backed by china, russia and iran, which allows the country to evade sanctions.\n\nmaduro banned opposition candidates from holding public office, restricted news coverage and placed close allies in the national electoral council to ensure his victory despite evidence of \"blatant\" voter fraud, according to the report.\n\nmore than 80% of the country lives below the poverty line, and almost 8 million venezuelans have fled the country since 2017.\n\nboth countries' situations have fueled the immigration crisis in the u.s.\n\nmaduro's latest crackdown in venezuela comes right out of a hit 1999 movie\n\n\"conflict, violence, political instability, poor economic conditions and natural disasters will continue to

negotiation that is the only way to end their wars.\n\nmark hannah courtesy of mark hannah\n\nbiden is right to help democratic countries confront their illiberal enemies. israel and ukraine suffered terrible crimes of aggression. but lofty expressions of unconditional support can paradoxically hurt the countries they are meant to help by hindering the kind of negotiated peace that saves civilian lives and restores stability.\n\nthe funds might motivate ukraine and israel to pursue unwinnable victories: the full restoration of ukraine\u2019s borders and reclamation of crimea, and the destruction of hamas, respectively. in international politics and armed conflict, fraught as they are with mutual distrust and competing views of fairness, sometimes countries can\u2019t achieve justice \u2014 they can only achieve peace.\n\nthe new infusion of aid gives the us a lot of leverage with ukraine and israel. washington has largely refused to exercise its leverage thus far, but it must do so now or peace in the near future doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nisraeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu continues to maintain that \u201ctotal victory\u201d over hamas is the only outcome he will accept. but as the war grinds on, israel reports having killed fewer than half of hamas\u2019 fighters while its tunnel network hasn\u2019t been completely dismantled, indicating the group can likely sustain an insurgency against israel for the foreseeable future. and even if it were possible to destroy hamas, that outcome could prove to be a catastrophic success when images of the accompanying civilian devastation fuel ever more radicalization among palestinians and stirs angry arab publics who pressure their leaders to scuttle arab-israeli normalization efforts.\n\nsimilarly, the ukrainian government insists it will continue fighting until it regains all of the territory it has lost, including crimea, which russia illegally annexed in 2014, and there is no sign the us administration is pushing it to reconsider. but as gen. mark milley, then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told me a year ago, \u201cneither side is likely to achieve their complete political objectives through military means\u201d so \u201cit will probably end somewhere, somehow at a negotiating table.\u201d and that was before ukraine lost some of its best troops and equipment in last summer\u2019s highly anticipated offensive, which failed to strike a knockout blow to russia.\n\nto its credit, the administration seems clear-eyed enough to privately acknowledge ukraine\u2019s chances for retaking additional territory are slim. but there is still no public indication the us is trying to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement. signaling american resolve can preserve ukraine\u2019s bargaining position, but it risks convincing ukraine to reject a reasonable peace deal \u2014 if one is eventually offered \u2014 and continue fighting in pursuit of morally righteous but unattainable goals.\n\nlikewise, while the administration has ramped up humanitarian aid to gaza, encouraged negotiations to get hamas to release israeli hostages and called for the palestinian authority to administer gaza, it could do more to convince israel to fundamentally rethink its destabilizing goals. the biden administration should publicly and privately convey to israel\u2019s leaders that their current strategy is unlikely to succeed and undermines regional security.\n\nthere will be at least a few objections to orienting american policy toward the best possible outcomes in these conflicts \u2014 achieving peace and stability in the near term \u2014 rather than the unrealistic goals of our partners.\n\nwar has a way of eliciting worldviews organized around simplistic binaries. after the terror attacks on september 11, 2001, then-president george w. bush declared that every country had to decide: \u201ceither you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\u201d when biden spoke of the war in ukraine, americans were told we faced a choice between offering kyiv unconditional support or \u201cwithdrawing\u201d from the conflict and letting putin \u201cerase\u201d ukraine. but these kinds of manichean views that divide the world into evil aggressors and righteous victims do not make impossible military victories any more achievable.\n\nsome people will say that the us can\u2019t simply tell ukraine and israel, both sovereign countries, what to do. indeed, this has largely been biden\u2019s public position, evident in his mantra \u201cnothing about ukraine without ukraine\u201d and in the state department\u2019s insistence that \u201cthe united states doesn\u2019t dictate to israel what it must do.\u201d\n\nthese countries do have agency \u2014 but so does the united states. american involvement in assisting these nations\u2019 war efforts gives it the right and responsibility to share the course of each conflict in ways that protect its interests. the us can respect ukraine\u2019s and israel\u2019s agency without subjugating its own.\n\nin ukraine, this doesn\u2019t mean threatening the withdrawal of aid, which would weaken its battlefield and negotiating position. instead, the us could have enforced the restrictions it had already made (on abrams tanks, f-16s, cluster munitions and long-range missiles) or it could now materially support diplomatic efforts as enthusiastically as military efforts. however, the recent aid package includes long-range missiles, or atacms, which suggests ukraine is readying an offensive against crimea. for a year and a half, biden judiciously refused to send these to ukraine, calling them a \u201cred line\u201d for putin, who might use nuclear weapons were crimea attacked.\n\nin israel, putting conditions on military aid is a better idea. the us did use leverage after an israeli military strike killed aid workers from world central kitchen \u2014 with sources telling cnn that biden warned netanyahu that the us would reconsider how it\u2019s supporting israel\u2019s war unless israel allowed for more humanitarian aid in gaza. after that, israel acceded to the ultimatum and, per a reported demand by biden, publicly announced the change that day. unfortunately, there\u2019s little evidence the president has kept up the pressure. when the aid package passed congress, a pro-israel lobbying group cheered that the security assistance came \u201cwith no added conditions.\u201d\n\none historical example illustrates how the us might use its leverage with netanyahu today. after israel encircled the egyptian military in the 1973 yom kippur war, secretary of state henry kissinger flew to tel aviv and pressured prime minister golda meir to enact a ceasefire. egypt\u2019s attack was, like that of hamas, an unprovoked and surprise act of aggression. kissinger feared a victory by the soviet-backed arab states. but recently declassified documents show he also feared an all-out israeli victory.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion\u2019s newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nkissinger wrote that \u201cfrom an israeli point of view, it is no disaster to have the whole arab world radicalized and anti-american, because this guarantees our continued support. from an american point of view, it is a disaster.\u201d kissinger advised that the us needed \u201cto be taken even more seriously\u201d by israel, and \u201cour insistence on a more politically oriented policy cannot go unheeded.\u201d this advice rings even truer today.\n\nfundamentally, negotiated settlements are often morally unsatisfying. russia shouldn\u2019t be allowed to invade a sovereign country and get away with it. israel has the right to defend itself. but too narrow a focus on what\u2019s morally just obscures an appreciation for what\u2019s strategically possible. what\u2019s possible, in both ukraine and gaza, is peace.",

leaders that their current strategy is unlikely to succeed and undermines regional security.\n\nthere will be at least a few objections to orienting american policy toward the best possible outcomes in these conflicts \u2014 achieving peace and stability in the near term \u2014 rather than the unrealistic goals of our partners.\n\nwar has a way of eliciting worldviews organized around simplistic binaries. after the terror attacks on september 11, 2001, then-president george w. bush declared that every country had to decide: \u201ceither you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\u201d when biden spoke of the war in ukraine, americans were told we faced a choice between offering kyiv unconditional support or \u201cwithdrawing\u201d from the conflict and letting putin \u201cerase\u201d ukraine. but these kinds of manichean views that divide the world into evil aggressors and righteous victims do not make impossible military victories any more achievable.\n\nsome people will say that the us can\u2019t simply tell ukraine and israel, both sovereign countries, what to do. indeed, this has largely been biden\u2019s public position, evident in his mantra \u201cnothing about ukraine without ukraine\u201d and in the state department\u2019s insistence that \u201cthe united states doesn\u2019t dictate to israel what it must do.\u201d\n\nthese countries do have agency \u2014 but so does the united states. american involvement in assisting these nations\u2019 war efforts gives it the right and responsibility to share the course of each conflict in ways that protect its interests. the us can respect ukraine\u2019s and israel\u2019s agency without subjugating its own.\n\nin ukraine, this doesn\u2019t mean threatening the withdrawal of aid, which would weaken its battlefield and negotiating position. instead, the us could have enforced the restrictions it had already made (on abrams tanks, f-16s, cluster munitions and long-range missiles) or it could now materially support diplomatic efforts as enthusiastically as military efforts. however, the recent aid package includes long-range missiles, or atacms, which suggests ukraine is readying an offensive against crimea. for a year and a half, biden judiciously refused to send these to ukraine, calling them a \u201cred line\u201d for putin, who might use nuclear weapons were crimea attacked.\n\nin israel, putting conditions on military aid is a better idea. the us did use leverage after an israeli military strike killed aid workers from world central kitchen \u2014 with sources telling cnn that biden warned netanyahu that the us would reconsider how it\u2019s supporting israel\u2019s war unless israel allowed for more humanitarian aid in gaza. after that, israel acceded to the ultimatum and, per a reported demand by biden, publicly announced the change that day. unfortunately, there\u2019s little evidence the president has kept up the pressure. when the aid package passed congress, a pro-israel lobbying group cheered that the security assistance came \u201cwith no added conditions.\u201d\n\none historical example illustrates how the us might use its leverage with netanyahu today. after israel encircled the egyptian military in the 1973 yom kippur war, secretary of state henry kissinger flew to tel aviv and pressured prime minister golda meir to enact a ceasefire. egypt\u2019s attack was, like that of hamas, an unprovoked and surprise act of aggression. kissinger feared a victory by the soviet-backed arab states. but recently declassified documents show he also feared an all-out israeli victory.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion\u2019s newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nkissinger wrote that \u201cfrom an israeli point of view, it is no disaster to have the whole arab world radicalized and anti-american, because this guarantees our continued support. from an american point of view, it is a disaster.\u201d kissinger advised that the us needed \u201cto be taken even more seriously\u201d by israel, and \u201cour insistence on a more politically oriented policy cannot go unheeded.\u201d this advice rings even truer today.\n\nfundamentally, negotiated settlements are often morally unsatisfying. russia shouldn\u2019t be allowed to invade a sovereign country and get away with it. israel has the right to defend itself. but too narrow a focus on what\u2019s morally just obscures an appreciation for what\u2019s strategically possible. what\u2019s possible, in both ukraine and gaza, is peace.",

[\u2026] ukraine will abide by any restrictions you put on them. so you could give them taurus. and you could add all sorts of restrictions about where you want it used or not used,\" wallace said.\n\nhe also dismissed comments made by scholz that suggested british and french troops are in ukraine, programming cruise missiles.\n\n\"he was wrong. [\u2026] i can't tell you how storm shadows and scalps are programmed. but it doesn't involve people standing around in an airport in ukraine, it doesn't need to do that,\" wallace said.\n\nwhile he understands scholz's reasons for concern regarding a possible escalation of the conflict, these are unfounded, wallace said.\n\n\"we've seen throughout this whole process that russia's red lines are like chalk, they just brush off the chalkboard,\" he said.\n\nwhile applauding germany for ramping up its support for ukraine, the former minister reiterated his harsh criticism of scholz's leadership.\n\n\"i think he's not a leader for conflict at the moment. and there is conflict on our shores. and i think he, you know, the point he doesn't understand deterrence, he doesn't understand ambiguity, he doesn't seem to understand that in the process we face in dealing with russia, looking either indecisive, or flip-flopping on certain decisions, or seeming to be out of step with your allies, only aids putin,\" wallace said.\n\nwallace served as uk defense secretary from 2019 to 2023.",

        "content": "serbian lawmakers on thursday voted into office a new government that reinstated two pro-russia officials who are sanctioned by the united states, reflecting persistent close ties with moscow despite the balkan nation's proclaimed bid to join the european union.\n\nprime minister milo\u0161 vu\u010devi\u0107's government got backing in a 152-61 vote in the 250-member parliament. the remaining 37 lawmakers were absent.\n\nus-sanctioned ex-intelligence chief with russian ties to be appointed serbian vice-premier\n\nthe government includes former intelligence chief aleksandar vulin, who has made several visits to russia in recent months, as one of several vice-premiers, along with nenad popovi\u0107, another russia supporter who has faced u.s. sanctions.\n\nthe foreign minister in the previous government, ivica da\u010di\u0107, also a pro-russia politician, will be in charge of the interior ministry in the new cabinet.\n\nthe vote followed a heated two-day debate. president aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107's ruling nationalist conservative serbian progressive party holds a comfortable majority after an election in december that fueled political tensions because of reports of widespread irregularities.\n\nthe increasingly authoritarian vu\u010di\u0107 has refused to join western sanctions against moscow over its full-scale invasion of ukraine, though serbia has condemned the aggression.\n\nvu\u010devi\u0107, the new prime minister, reiterated that belgrade doesn't intend to impose sanctions on russia and \"cannot and will not give up\" its friendship with russia. integration into the eu remains a \"strategic goal.\"\n\nhe added that the \"best possible\" ties with the u.s. are also in serbia's interest.\n\n\"i firmly believe that our relations can once again be on a high level,\" vu\u010devi\u0107 said.\n\nfilip ejdus, a security analyst and a belgrade university professor, described the new government's composition as \"spin\" designed for the west and russia, and for voters at home.\n\n\"it sends a message to the eu that they should not push belgrade too much over democracy, rule of law, or kosovo if they want to keep serbia in its orbit,\" ejdus said. \"at the same time, it signals to moscow a readiness to strengthen the strategic partnership with russia.\"\n\nthe u.s. imposed sanctions on vulin in july, accusing him of involvement in illegal arms shipments, drug trafficking and misuse of public office.\n\nthe u.s. treasury department\u2019s office of foreign assets control said that vulin used his public authority to help a u.s.-sanctioned serbian arms dealer move illegal arms shipments across serbia\u2019s borders. vulin is also accused of involvement in a drug trafficking ring, according to u.s. authorities.\n\nvulin, who in the past had served as both the army and police chief, has recently received two medals of honor from russia, one from the federal security service, or fsb, and the other was awarded to him by russian president vladimir putin.\n\npopovi\u0107, a businessman and a former government minister, has \"used his russia-based businesses to enrich himself and gain close connections with kremlin senior leaders,\" the u.s. treasury said last november in a statement.\n\nopposition lawmaker radomir lazovic criticized the inclusion of the disputed ministers. lazovic said \"these individuals shouldn\u2019t be part of the government, not just because they are blacklisted, but because their harmful behavior has hurt the citizens of serbia.\"\n\nthe u.s. sanctions against individuals and companies in the balkans are designed to counter attempts to undermine peace and stability in the volatile region and russia's \"malign\" influence.\n\nthe west has stepped up efforts to lure the troubled region into its fold, fearing that russia could stir unrest to avert attention from the war in ukraine. the balkans went through multiple wars in the 1990s, and tensions still persist.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nserbia's falling democracy record has pushed the country away from eu integration, explained ejdus. reports of election fraud at the dec. 17 vote triggered street protests and clashes.\n\n\"vu\u010di\u0107 is still pretending to be on the eu path because it\u2019s beneficial for serbia\u2019s economy, and the eu tolerates his authoritarian tendencies out of fear of instability that could be caused in its backyard if belgrade was lost to russia and china,\" ejdus said.",

(ksenia ivanova for the washington post)\n\ntwo weeks before the start of his 25th year as russia\u2019s supreme political leader, vladimir putin made a sweeping proclamation: \u201cwars are won by teachers.\u201d the remark, which putin repeated twice during his year-end news conference in december, shed light on a campaign he is waging that has received little attention outside wartime russia: to imbue the country\u2019s education system with patriotism, purge universities of western influences, and quash any dissent among professors and students on campuses that are often hotbeds of political activism.\n\nat st. petersburg state university, this meant dismantling a prestigious humanities program called the faculty of liberal arts and sciences. for more than a decade, until may 2022, the faculty \u2014 or college \u2014 was led by alexei kudrin, a liberal economist and former finance minister who had been a close associate of putin\u2019s since the early 1990s, when they

a restored superpower. end of carousel in a radical reshaping of russia\u2019s education system, curriculums are being redrawn to stress patriotism and textbooks rewritten to belittle ukraine, glorify russia and whitewash the totalitarian soviet past. these changes \u2014 the most sweeping to schooling in russia since the 1930s \u2014 are a core part of putin\u2019s effort to harness the war in ukraine to remaster his country as a regressive, militarized state.\n\nsince the february 2022 invasion of ukraine, leaders of russian universities, which are overwhelmingly funded by the state, have zealously adopted the kremlin\u2019s intolerance of any dissent or self-organization, according to an extensive examination by the washington post of events on campuses across russia, including interviews with students and professors both still in the country and in exile.\n\nprofessors who spoke out against the war, or allowed safe spaces for students to question it, have been fired. students who picketed or posted on social media for peace were expelled.\n\nmeanwhile, those who volunteer to fight in ukraine have been celebrated in line with putin\u2019s promises that war heroes and their descendants will become the new russian elite, with enhanced social benefits, including special preference for children seeking to enter top academic programs. normally, such programs require near-perfect grades and high scores on competitive exams \u2014 uniform standards that applicants from all societal backgrounds have relied on for decades.\n\nadvertisement\n\nand the most fundamental precept of academic life \u2014 the freedom to think independently, to challenge conventional assumptions and pursue new, bold ideas \u2014 has been eroded by edicts that classrooms become echo chambers of the authoritarian nativism and historical distortions that putin uses to justify his war and his will.\n\nas a result, a system of higher learning that once was a beacon for students across the developing world is now shutting itself off from peer academies in the west, severing one of the few ties that had survived years of political turbulence. freedom of thought is being trampled, if not eradicated. eminent scholars have fled for positions abroad, while others said in interviews that they are planning to do so.\n\nat the russian state university for the humanities in moscow, officials last july created the ivan ilyin higher political school, which is now being led by alexander dugin, a fervent pro-putin and orthodox christian ideologue who was tasked with \u201crevising domestic scientific and educational paradigms and bringing them into line with our traditional russian spiritual and moral values.\u201d\n\n\u201cthere has been a catastrophic degradation in western humanitarian history,\u201d dugin said at a january seminar on transforming russian humanities education. \u201cthis is evidenced by gender problems, postmodernism and

independent russian news accounts, social media posts, and other documentary evidence. the post also relied on kremlin transcripts of remarks by president vladimir, government decrees, and official statements issued by universities. photographer ksenia ivanova reported from st. petersburg. reporting on russia is challenging, and it has grown more difficult since the invasion of ukraine in february 2022. at times, people in russia are afraid to speak with journalists or to say things that they worry could provoke the authorities. many people in russia avoid speaking in public about politics or the war in ukraine, fearing they could be reported to the authorities by neighbors or by classmates . some analysts still inside the country are known to comment carefully, wary of provoking the kremlin. for these reasons, the post agreed to withhold the identities of some people interviewed who expressed concerns about their safety. for those reluctant to meet in person because of security concerns, we agreed to conduct interviews on encrypted internet platforms. mary ilyushina, a post reporter covering russia since 2021, previously worked for cnn\u2019s moscow bureau as a field producer. she speaks russian, english, ukrainian and arabic and is a graduate of moscow state university. robyn dixon, the post\u2019s moscow bureau chief since november 2019, is on her third stint covering russia, having had previous assignments with the los angeles times and the sydney morning herald and the age dating back to 1993. she speaks russian, french and english. francesca ebel,

german) from moscow linguistic university. 1 / 4 end of carousel last month, students pushed an online petition to protest the naming of the school after ilyin, a philosopher who defended hitler and mussolini in world war ii and advocated for the return of czarist autocracy in russia. in a statement to tass, the state-controlled news service, the university denounced the petition as \u201cpart of the information war of the west and its supporters against russia\u201d and asserted, without providing evidence, that the group behind it had no connection to students at the school. programs specializing in the liberal arts and sciences are primary targets because they are viewed as breeding grounds for dissent. major universities have cut the hours spent studying western governments, human rights and international law, and even the english language. \u201cwe were destroyed,\u201d said denis skopin, a philosophy professor at smolny college who was fired for criticizing the war. \u201cbecause the last thing people who run universities need are unreliable actors who do the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing, think in a different way, and teach their students to do the same.\u201d\n\nthe demise of smolny college the demise of smolny college the demise of smolny college the demise of smolny college\n\nst. petersburg state university, commonly known as spbu, has long been one of russia\u2019s premier academies of higher learning. it is the alma mater of both putin, who graduated with a degree in law in 1975, and former president dmitry medvedev, who received his law degree 12 years later and now routinely threatens nuclear strikes on the west as deputy chairman of russia\u2019s national security council.\n\nin many ways, the university has become the leader in reprisals against students and staff not loyal to the kremlin, with one newspaper dubbing it the \u201crepressions champion\u201d of russian education. its halls have become a microcosm of modern russia in which conservatives in power are pushing out the few remaining western-oriented liberals.\n\nlike other aspects of putin\u2019s remastering of russia \u2014 such as patriotic mandates in the arts and the redrawing of the role of women to focus on childbearing \u2014 the shift in education started well before the invasion of ukraine. in 2021, russia ended a more than 20-year-old exchange program between smolny college and bard college in new york state by designating the private american liberal arts school an \u201cundesirable\u201d organization.\n\njonathan becker, bard\u2019s vice president for academic affairs and a professor of political studies, said the demise of smolny was emblematic of a wider shift in russia as well as a new intolerance of the west.\n\n\u201ca huge number of faculty have been let go, several departments closed, core liberal arts programs which focus on critical thinking have been eliminated,\u201d becker said. \u201call of that has happened, and it\u2019s not just happened at smolny \u2014 it has happened elsewhere. but we were doubly problematic because we both represent critical thinking and partnership with the west. and neither of those are acceptable in present-day russia.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nin october 2022, in a scene captured on video and posted on social media, dozens of students gathered in a courtyard to bid a tearful goodbye to skopin, smolny\u2019s cherished philosophy professor who was fired for an \u201cimmoral act\u201d \u2014 protesting putin\u2019s announcement of a partial military mobilization to replenish his depleted forces in ukraine.\n\nthe month before, according to court records and interviews, skopin was arrested at an antiwar rally. he ended up sharing a jail cell with another professor, artem kalmykov, a young mathematician who had recently finished his phd at the university of zurich.\n\nthat fall, the university launched an overhaul that all but shut smolny college and replaced the curriculum with a thoroughly revamped arts and humanities program.\n\nthe dismantling of smolny marked the resolution of a years-long feud between kudrin, the liberal-economist dean, and nikolai kropachev, the university rector, whom tutors and students described as a volatile character with a passion for building ties in the highest echelons of the government.\n\n\u201c it\u2019s hard to

how kropachev once interrupted a meeting with students and hinted that he needed to take a call from putin, in what the student viewed as a boast of his direct access to the russian leader. both st. petersburg state university and moscow state university were assigned a special status in 2009, under which their rectors are appointed personally by the president.\n\nskopin, who earned his phd in france, and his cellmate, kalmykov, were perfect examples of the type of academic that russia aspired to attract from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s \u2014 enticed after studying abroad to bring knowledge home amid booming investment in higher education. but by 2022, the system seemed to have no need for them.\n\nvideo of the gathering in the courtyard shows students erupting in sustained

in a situation where out of 30 original faculty staff, we had just three tutors left,\u201d said polina ulanovskaya, a sociology student and activist who led the student union. \u201cand the quality of education definitely suffered, especially all of the politics-related classes.\u201d\n\nulanovskaya said that on the political science track, only two professors have stayed, and many classes were eliminated, including a human rights course. there are now just two courses offered in english, down from 21.\n\nwith every new professor, ulanovskaya said, she felt a need to test the waters. would the word \u201cgender\u201d trigger them? could she say something opposition-leaning? what would be a red flag?\n\nulanovskaya opted out of writing a thesis on her main research topic \u2014 russian social movements, politicization of workers and historic-preservation activists \u2014 out of fear that it would be blacklisted. instead, she wrote about uruguay.\n\n\u201cthe main problem at the faculty now is that there is no freedom and especially no sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201ci guess there is no such thing anywhere in russia now ... you can\u2019t trust anyone in any university.\u201d\n\na few weeks after the post interviewed ulanovskaya last fall, she was expelled, formally for failing an exam, but she and skopin said they believe it was retaliation for her activism.\n\nanother student, yelizaveta antonova, was supposed to get her bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism just days after legendary novaya gazeta newspaper reporter yelena milashina was brutally beaten in chechnya, the small muslim-majority republic in southern russia under the dictatorial rule of ramzan kadyrov.\n\nantonova, who interned at novaya gazeta and looked up to milashina, felt she could not accept her diploma without showing support for her colleague. she and a roommate printed a photo of milashina, depicting the reporter\u2019s shaved head and bandaged hands, to stage a demonstration at their graduation ceremony \u2014 much to the dismay of other classmates, who sought to block the protest.\n\n\u201cthey essentially prevented us from going on stage,\u201d antonova said. \u201cso we did it outside of the law school, and we felt it was extra symbolic because putin and medvedev studied in these halls.\u201d\n\nthey held up the poster for about half an hour, until another student threatened them by saying riot police were on the way to arrest them. antonova believes the protest cost her a spot in graduate school, where she hoped to continue her research comparing russia\u2019s media landscape before and after the invasion.\n\neight months after the graduation ceremony, authorities launched a case against antonova and her roommate for staging an

cliques ranging from conservatives and kremlin loyalists to unyielding opposition-minded liberals, according to interviews with students and professors.\n\nthe february 2022 invasion of ukraine caused a deeper split. some students and professors openly praised putin\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d as the kremlin called the war, while others joined rallies against it.\n\n\u201cthe war gave them carte blanche,\u201d said michael martin, 22, a former star at the college \u2014 to which he was automatically admitted after winning two nationwide academic competitions and where he earned straight a\u2019s.\n\nadvertisement\n\nmartin was a leader of the student council, which on the day of the invasion issued an antiwar manifesto quickly drafted in a cafe.\n\nanother history student, fedor solomonov, took the opposite view and praised the special military operation on social media. when solomonov was called up as part of the mobilization, he declined to take a student deferral and went to fight. he died on the front on april 1, 2023.\n\nsoon after solomonov\u2019s death, screenshots from internal chats where students often debated history and politics were leaked and went viral on pro-war telegram channels. in some, martin and other classmates expressed antiwar sentiments, while another showed a message \u2014 allegedly written by an assistant professor, mikhail belousov \u2014 vaguely describing events in ukraine as \u201crashism,\u201d a wordplay combining \u201crussia\u201d and \u201cfascism.\u201d\n\nin an aggressive online campaign, pro-war activists demanded that belousov, who denied writing the message, be fired and that the antiwar students, whom they labeled \u201ca pro-ukrainian organized crime group,\u201d be expelled.\n\n\u201ca cell of anti-russian students led by a russophobe associate professor is operating at the history faculty,\u201d read posts on readovka, a radical outlet with 2.5 million followers. \u201cthey are rabid liberals who hate their country.\u201d belousov was dismissed and seven students, including martin, were accused of desecrating solomonov\u2019s memory and expelled.\n\nbelousov has gone underground and could not be reached for comment.\n\nshare this article share\n\n\u201cthey essentially tried to make me do the sieg heil,\u201d martin said, recalling the expulsion hearing, where he said the committee repeatedly asked leading questions trying to get him to say the war was justified. the committee also asked him repeatedly about solomonov.\n\n\u201ci said he was for the war and i was against it \u2014 we could argue about that,\u201d martin said. \u201ci didn\u2019t find anything funny or interesting in this \u2014 i\u2019m truly sorry for what happened to him, but at the same time, i don\u2019t think that he did something good or great by going to war.\u201d\n\nmartin said that as the war raged on, the university began \u201cglorifying death\u201d and praising alumni who had joined the military.\n\nadvertisement\n\nthis narrative also warped the curriculum.\n\na few weeks into the invasion, the school introduced a class on modern ukrainian history, with a course

degree in library science. the key message of the course is that the soviet union had no role in the start of world war ii \u2014 a denial of russia\u2019s joint invasion of poland with nazi germany in 1939.\n\naccording to a government document reviewed by the post, russia\u2019s higher education ministry plans to introduce this course at other universities to ensure the \u201ccivic-patriotic and spiritual-moral education of youth,\u201d specifically future lawyers, teachers and historians, and to \u201ccorrect false ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cthese are obviously propaganda courses that are aimed at turning historians into court apologists,\u201d martin said.\n\nmartin was expelled days before he was supposed to defend his thesis. he quickly left the country after warnings that he and his classmates could be charged with discrediting the army, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. a criminal case was initiated against belousov on charges of rehabilitating nazism.\n\n\u201cthis is all very reminiscent of the stalinist 1930s purges,\u201d martin said. \u201cthe limit of tolerated protest now is to sit silently and say nothing. there is despair at the faculty and a feeling that they have crushed everything.\u201d\n\nnew russian elite new russian elite new russian elite new russian elite\n\nto lure more russian men to fight in ukraine, the government has promised their families various sweeteners, including cheap mortgages, large life insurance payments and education benefits for their children.\n\nin 2022, putin approved changes to education laws to grant children of soldiers who fought in ukraine admissions preferences at russia\u2019s best universities \u2014 schools that normally accept only students with near-perfect exam scores and impressive high school records.\n\nnow, at least 10 percent of all fully funded university spots must be allocated to students eligible for the military preference. those whose fathers were killed or wounded do not need to pass entry exams.\n\nthe new law solidified a previous putin decree that gave special preferences to soldiers and their children. in the 2023-24 academic year, about 8,500 students were enrolled based on these preferences, government officials said. according to an investigation by the russian-language outlet important stories, nearly 900 students were admitted to 13 top universities through war quotas, with most failing to meet the normal exam score threshold.\n\nin areas of ukraine captured by russian forces since february 2022, a different takeover of the education system is underway, with moscow imposing its curriculum and standards just as it did after invading and illegally annexing crimea in 2014.\n\nfor the 2023-24 academic year, according to the russian prime minister\u2019s office, more than 5 percent of fully state-financed tuition stipends \u2014 roughly 37,000 out of 626,000 \u2014 were allocated for students at universities in donetsk, luhansk, kherson or zaporizhzhia, the four occupied or partly occupied areas of ukraine that putin has claimed to be annexed.\n\nadvertisement\n\nthe relatively large allocation of tuition aid in occupied areas shows how financial assistance and education are central to putin\u2019s effort to seize lands in southeast ukraine and absorb its population into russia in violation of international law.\n\ndeans of several leading russian universities have made highly publicized trips to occupied ukraine to urge students there to enroll into russian schools, part of a multipronged effort to bring residents into moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\nthe moscow-based higher school of economics, once considered russia\u2019s most liberal university, recently established patronage over universities in

valery falkov said russian universities would undergo significant changes in the next half-decade, overseen by the national program \u201cpriority 2030,\u201d which envisions curriculums that ensure

political opponents, launching a devastating war in ukraine and concentrating all power in his hands.\n\nat the ceremony in the gilded grand kremlin palace, putin placed his hand on the russian constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.\n\n\u201cwe are a united and great people and together we will overcome all obstacles, realize all our plans, together we will win,\u201d putin said after being sworn in.\n\nsince succeeding president boris yeltsin in the waning hours of 1999, putin has transformed russia from a country emerging from economic collapse to a pariah state that threatens global security. following the 2022 invasion of ukraine that has become europe\u00b4s biggest conflict since world war ii, russia has been heavily sanctioned by the west and is turning to other regimes like china, iran and north korea for support.\n\nalready in office for nearly a quarter-century and the longest-serving kremlin leader since josef stalin, putin\u00b4s new term doesn\u00b4t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.\n\nin a heavily choreographed performance, putin was pictured in his office looking at his papers before walking along the kremlin\u00b4s long corridors, pausing at one point to look at a painting, on the way to his inauguration.\n\nhis guard of honor waited in the sleet and rain for hours, in temperatures hovering just above freezing, while putin made the brief journey to the grand kremlin palace in his auras limousine.\n\nputin used the the first moments of his fifth term to thank the \u201cheroes\u201d of his war in ukraine and to rail against the west.\n\nrussia \u201cdoes not refuse dialogue with western states,\u201d he said. rather, he said, \u201cthe choice is theirs: do they intend to continue trying to contain russia, continue the policy of aggression, continuous pressure on our country for years, or look for a path to cooperation and peace.\u201d\n\nhe was greeted with applause when he entered the hall with more than 2,500 invited guests. they included senior members of the russian government as well as celebrities including american actor steven seagal.\n\nneither

attended even though top eu diplomat josep borrell said he told them \u201cthe right thing to do is not to attend this inauguration,\u201d because putin is the subject of an arrest warrant by the international criminal court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from ukraine.\n\namong those present was the french ambassador, according to a french diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\na 30-gun salute followed putin\u2019s remarks. he reviewed the presidential regiment in the kremlin\u2019s cathedral square in a light drizzle and then walked into nearby annunciation cathedral for a blessing from patriarch kirill, head of the russian orthodox church.\n\nduring the brief service, kirill compared putin to prince alexander nevsky, the medieval ruler who \u201ccourageously defended their people on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nhe reminded putin that the head of state sometimes \u201chas to take fateful and formidable decisions\u201d that can lead to victims, an apparent reference to the many casualties in ukraine \u2013 a conflict the church has endorsed.\n\nthe

speech in february, putin vowed to fulfill moscow\u00b4s goals in ukraine, and do what is needed to \u201cdefend our sovereignty and security of our citizens.\u201d\n\nshortly after his orchestrated reelection in march, putin suggested that a confrontation between nato and russia is possible, and he declared he wanted to carve out a buffer zone in ukraine to protect his country from cross-border attacks.\n\nthe russian government has now been dissolved so that putin can name a new prime minister and cabinet.\n\none key area to watch is the defense ministry.\n\nlast month, deputy defense minister timur ivanov \u2013 a protege of defense minister sergei shoigu \u2013 was detained on charges of bribery amid reports of rampant corruption. some analysts have suggested shoigu could become a victim of the government reshuffle but that would be a bold move, with the war still raging.\n\nat home, putin\u2019s popularity is closely tied to improving living standards for ordinary russians.\n\nputin on tuesday once again promised russians a prosperous future, but since the invasion of ukraine, many have seen the cost of living rise.\n\nputin began his term in 2018 by promising to get russia into the top five global economies, vowing it should be \u201cmodern and dynamic.\u201d instead, russia\u2019s economy has pivoted to a war footing, and authorities are spending record amounts on defense.\n\nanalysts say now that putin has secured another six years in power, the government could take the unpopular steps of raising taxes to fund the war and pressure more men to join the military.\n\nin the years following the invasion, authorities have cracked down on any form of dissent with a ferocity not seen since soviet times.\n\nputin indicated tuesday that he would continue to silence critics.\n\nhe told his audience in the grand kremlin palace to remember the \u201ctragic cost of internal turmoil and upheaval,\u201d and said that russia \u201cmust be strong and absolutely resistant to any challenges and threats.\u201d\n\nputin enters his fifth term with practically no opposition inside the country.\n\nlaws have been enacted that threaten long prison terms

(its win in that instance was part of a larger coalition and with decisive american economic assistance.) soviet forces were in trouble in afghanistan immediately after their 1979 invasion and had to withdraw a decade later.\n\nand the russian army of today is not the red army. russia is not the ussr. soviet ukraine was a source of resources and soldiers for the red army. in that victory of 1945, ukrainian soldiers in the red army took huge losses \u2014 greater than american, british and french losses combined. it was disproportionately ukrainians who fought their war to berlin in the uniform of the red army.\n\ntoday, russia is fighting not together with ukraine but against ukraine. it is fighting a war of aggression on the territory of another state. and it lacks the american economic support \u2014 lend-lease \u2014 that the red army needed to defeat nazi germany. in this constellation, there is no particular reason to expect russia to win. one would expect, instead, that russia\u2019s only chance is to prevent the west from helping ukraine \u2014 by persuading us that its victory is inevitable, so that we don\u2019t apply our decisive economic power.\n\nthe last six months bear this out: russia\u2019s minor battlefield victories came at a time when the united states was delaying ukraine aid, rather than supplying it.\n\ntoday\u2019s russia is a new state. it has existed since 1991. like brezhnev before him, russian president vladimir putin rules through nostalgia. he refers to the soviet and also the russian imperial past. but the russian empire also lost wars. it lost the crimean war in 1856. it lost the russo-japanese war in 1905. it lost the first world war in 1917. in none of those three cases was russia able to keep forces in the field for more than about three years.\n\nin the united states there is great nervousness about a russian defeat. if something seems impossible, we cannot imagine what could happen next. and so there is a tendency, even among supporters of ukraine, to think that the best resolution is a tie.\n\nsuch thinking is unrealistic. and it reveals, behind the nerves, a strange american conceit.\n\nno one can guide a war in such a way. and nothing in our prior attempts to influence russia suggests that we can exercise that kind of influence. russia and ukraine are both fighting to win. the questions are: who will win, and with what consequences?\n\nif russia wins, the consequences are horrifying: a risk of a larger war in europe, more likelihood of a chinese adventure in the pacific, the weakening of international legal order generally, the likely spread of nuclear weapons, the loss of faith in democracy.\n\nsoviet soldiers during a patrol in kabul, afghanistan, april 25, 1988. the soviet union invaded afghanistan in late 1979 and remained there until 1989. robert nickelsberg/getty images\n\nit is normal for russia to lose wars. and, in general, this led russians to reflect and reform. defeat in crimea forced an autocracy to end serfdom. russia\u2019s loss to japan led to an experiment with elections. the soviet failure in afghanistan led to gorbachev\u2019s reforms and thus the end of the cold war.\n\nbeneath the russian particularities, history offers a more general and still more reassuring lesson about empires. russia is fighting today an imperial war. it denies the existence of the ukrainian state and nation, and it carries out atrocities that recall the worst of the european imperial past.\n\nthe peaceful europe of today consists of powers that lost their last imperial wars and then chose democracy. it is not only possible to lose your last imperial war: it is also good, not only for the world, but for you.\n\nrussia can lose this war, and should, for the sake of russians themselves. a defeated russia means not only the end of senseless losses of young life in ukraine. it is also russia\u2019s one chance to become a post-imperial country, one where reform is possible, one where russians themselves might be protected by law and able to cast meaningful votes.\n\ndefeat in ukraine is russia\u2019s historical chance for normality \u2014 as russians who want democracy and the rule of law will say.\n\nlike the united states and europe, ukraine celebrates the victory of 1945 on may 8th rather than may 9th. ukrainians have every right to remember and interpret that victory: they suffered more than russians from german occupation and died in huge numbers on the battlefield.\n\nand ukrainians are right to think that russia today, like nazi germany in 1945, is a fascist imperialist regime that can and must be defeated. fascism was defeated last time because a coalition held firm and applied its superior economic power. the same holds true now.",

        "content": "during these may days, when we remember our common victory - the victory of the soviet people in the great patriotic war, we would like to recall the words of the belarusian president: \u201cthe more time passes from the heroic and tragic events, the more we venerate the sacrificial feat of our grandfathers and great grandfathers, those, who saved the mankind from enslavement and extermination.\u201d but let's figure out why the more time passes, the stronger is our desire to stand up for truth and justice, and the more fiercely the west holds onto global dominance. why the farther we are from those events, the more careful we are of our historical memory and the more barbaric our neighbors are towards war monuments. the war crimes have no statute of limitations, do they? we discuss this in a new episode of belta\u2019s youtube project \u201cafter the fact: lukashenko\u2019s decisions\u201d.\n\nwhat was the war for belarusians?\n\nsome chided belarus for its over-focus on the war commemoration as if no important events happened ever since. to be honest, until recently, some of us teased the older generation over their \"anything but war\" mantra and the traditional wishes for a peaceful sky. it turned out that it was a mistake. big mistake.\n\nthe great russian commander alexander suvorov is credited with the following words: \u201cthe war is not over until the last soldier is buried!\" he is believed to have said them after the defeat of the turkish army at the battle of rymnik. russia lost a couple of hundred people in that battle\u2026\n\nnow let's get back to our history. in april 2021, the general prosecutor's office launched a criminal case into the genocide of the population of belarus during the great patriotic war and the post-war period. the german invaders and their accomplices killed more than three million belarusians. almost 400,000 people were taken to germany for slave labor. more than 12,000 villages were completely or partially destroyed. several hundred of them shared the sad fate of khatyn. more than 580 death camps were established on the territory of our country, and almost 200 major punitive operations were carried out. \"the investigation of the criminal case into the genocide of the belarusian people continues. for a little more than three years of the investigation, we obtained the information confirming that the scale of the tragedy during the great patriotic war is much greater than previously thought. one of the goals of the investigation is to establish all the facts of the genocide that took place on the territory of our country during the great patriotic war. but the most important goal is to bring to justice all nazi criminals who committed atrocities against the belarusian people. we are moving towards this goal. as part of the criminal case we have put together a list of henchmen and their accomplices that will soon be persecuted by the prosecutor general of belarus,\u201d said sergei shikunets, deputy head of the department for supervision over the investigation of particularly important criminal cases of the prosecutor general's office.\n\nif we apply suvorov's words to our realities, will the war ever end for belarusians?\n\nthis is why the memory of those who died in the fight for the freedom and independence of our motherland, for the liberation of the planet from nazism, the memory of the victims of nazism is sacred for our people. this has become part of the national idea.\n\n\u201crecently we hear more people say: \u2018what do we need this for. let us forget everything\u2019. a hideous thing hides behind these seemingly harmless words. it is an attempt not only to forget but also rewrite the history of the war, take away the feat of our people. we must not forget it. we must not give great victory away. it is a testimony of the greatness of the soviet people whose descendants we are,\u201d belarusian president aleksandr lukashenko said at a ceremony to unveil the trostenets memorial in 2015.\n\napproaches by belarus and its neighbors to honoring the past\n\nlet's compare. in 2020, the ola memorial was opened in svetlogorsk district on the site of the village destroyed during the war. almost 2,000 people were burned here, more than half of them were children. that's twelve khatyns! in the same year, a monument to the burned villages was dedicated in mogilev oblast.\n\ntwo years ago, the khatyn memorial complex was declared an all-belarusian construction site. student teams from all over belarus worked here. the project was financed from the budget and also with the money earned during the national cleanup day. all in all, about br5 million was spent on the renovation of the memorial. roughly speaking, it was $1.5-2 million. in 2023, more than 500,000 people visited khatyn, which was almost twice as many as in previous years. such a flow of tourists was associated with the opening of a unique museum here.\n\nat the same time, latvia was busy too: the riga city council proposed to demolish the monument to the liberators of riga. this idea was supported by the president of the country. the city authorities bulldozed the flowers laid at the memorial, opened criminal and administrative cases against the protesters, promised to expel from the country all foreigners who joined the protesters... it came to the point of absurd: they decided to drain the pond near the monument and feed the fish to animals in riga zoo. the dismantling of the memorial in honor of soviet soldiers cost \u20ac2 million. it turned out that this was just the beginning: the latvian government had prepared a list of 69 soviet war memorials to be demolished.\n\nlatvia\u2019s actions were not unique for europe. poland has been implementing its decommunization law since 2017. the dismantling of soviet monuments and memorials in honor of the liberators has become almost a national idea in estonia and lithuania. ukraine has eagerly joined this dance on the bones.\n\nit became almost a matter of honor for kiev to replace the soviet emblem on europe\u2019s highest monument with the ukrainian trident coat of arms. the project to \u2018decommunize\u2019 the ukrainian motherland monument cost about $500,000. this is not about money (although it could have been used to address more pressing problems in ukraine). the question is whether such \u201crebranding\u201d made ukraine greater. after all kiev, minsk, moscow, and other capitals of the post-soviet republics survived thanks to those whom these monuments commemorate!\n\n\u201ctoday you and i wonder about the same thing: could the heroes of the war have imagined that 80 years later their children and grandchildren would have to fight for the truth about the great victory, for the right to honor the victorious warriors on this holy day? today we should openly speak about the fact that during the great patriotic war belarusian civilian population was subjected to a massive and systemic extermination. we will never forget that millions of our compatriots fell on battlefields, perished in death camps, were hanged, shot or tortured to death by gestapo. we remember it and if someone forgets it, we will remind them,\u201d the belarusian president said in 2021.\n\nwhom does the memory of the victims and heroes of the war give hard time today?\n\n\u201cthe memory of the victims of the war, the heroism of our fathers and grandfathers gives a hard time to some people, first of all, to the ideological followers of murderers and traitors. it is they who honor the executioners in their parliaments today. it was they who started the war against graves and monuments in poland, the baltic states and ukraine. complete madmen! do they think that by destroying a monument they will destroy the memory that lives in the hearts of the people? the people who found the strength to build new peaceful relations with those states that only yesterday brought suffering and death to our lands,\u201d aleksandr lukashenko said as he attended a ceremony together with russian president vladimir putin to unveil the memorial to the ussr civilians who fell victim of nazi genocide during great patriotic war in january 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhy does this great monument bear importance for our peoples? after all, there are thousands of war monuments in russia and belarus. everything is simple. the overwhelming majority of them honor the heroes - red army soldiers and partisans, the people who defended their land with weapons in their hands. it is as important to pay tribute to the people who could not defend themselves.\n\n\u201cthe prosecutor general's office of belarus nominated brest fortress for inclusion in the unesco world heritage list as a memorial symbolizing the fight against nazism, the fight against the policy of genocide throughout the world. the prosecutor general's office also suggested awarding the international status of historical and cultural heritage to the trostenets concentration camp, which was the largest one in terms of the number of people killed there. large-scale work is conducted to set up expositions dedicated to the genocide of the belarusian people in all corners of our country. together with the education ministry we have prepared supplements about the genocide of the belarusian people to the history textbooks,\u201d representative of the general prosecutor's office sergei shikunets said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cas long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war\u201d\n\nagain we may ask a rhetorical question: why our european neighbors are deeply preoccupied with demolishing soviet memorials? why do belarus and russia try their best to perpetuate the memory of that terrible tragedy? a common tragedy for all our peoples.\n\nduring that ceremony aleksandr lukashenko reminded us of a simple truth: we cannot change the past, but it is in our power to protect the future. for this, we should cherish our common historical memory, the brotherhood of peoples and the unbreakable unity of the nations that fought against the world evil and defeated it. at a time when some forces prefer to forget the terrible pages of the second world war, try to shift the accents in terms of responsibility of some countries, belarus stands guards of the true history. not only in stone. back in october 2004 aleksandr lukashenko signed a decree to establish a new insignia - a pennant \u2018for valor and perseverance during the great patriotic war\u2019. it was awarded to 36 settlements of belarus. each of these places became a true citadel of fortitude, where both soldiers and local residents showed incredible bravery.\n\n\u201cas long as we build monuments, as long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war, we will avoid such terrible tragedies. as soon as we forget the way to these holy places, a war will certainly follow,\u201d the belarusian leader warned.\n\nis it possible to forgive the nazis\u2019 crimes?\n\nthanks to search operations, many horrifying facts have been uncovered and new evidence of terrible crimes has been discovered over the past three years.\n\n\u201cthe german fascist invaders and their accomplices spared no one: either children, or the elderly, or women. in this exhibit we see fragments of shoes found at the excavation site in ivanovshchina forest in logoisk district, minsk oblast. in that pit of about 80 meters in diameter we found bone remains belonging to at least 1,021 people. the most horrifying thing is that we found skeletal remains of children and women. we had to remove the bone remains with our own hands. it was really hard to do this emotionally because we understood we were touching history. it was hard to imagine what happened in that place 80 years ago: people waiting for their death near the pit. people were brought to the edge of the pit, forced to their knees and shot dead. those who were wounded were simply buried alive,\u201d sergei shikunets said.\n\nthousands of concentration camp prisoners have shared their memories. their stories leave no one indifferent. we would like to tell you about the fate of one girl - emilia kopytok. she, a 10-year-old red-haired girl then, called squirrel by her loving parents, went through six concentration camps. and she survived! the child saw baths with human fat from which soap was made, saw little children and their mothers brutally murdered. is it possible to forgive such things? is it possible to forget?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cwhen we were allowed to get off carriages, i saw a forest, german guards and german shepherd dogs. and a huge bonfire. nearby there was another train full of jews. the jews were also getting off train, and mothers were carrying small children in their arms. they were all very pretty and curly-haired. these children were grabbed and thrown into the bonfire. the mothers who ran after their children screaming were bayoneted and thrown into the fire too. there was terrible screaming, terrible howling, terrible crying, terrible barking of dogs. the bonfire was burning like a candle,\u201d emilia kopytok said.\n\nbelarusians are a strong nation. strong because they never forget. strong because they are ready to forgive. but is it really a time to forgive?",
