        "content": "This century has one overarching theme: the fall of the west, that is, the US and its European allies. Every major crisis accelerates the unmistakable trend. The war in Gaza is just the latest manifestation. Western newspapers are now littered with articles full of the panicked realisation that more is buried in the rubble of Gaza than just thousands of unidentified bodies. \u201cThe damage to Israel\u2019s reputation,\u201d writes Matthew Parris in the Times, \u201cso much less manifest than shattered hospitals in Gaza, is incalculable.\u201d Yes, but it would be an error to believe that it is Israel\u2019s problem alone. When the former Palestinian negotiator Diana Buttu told me this was an \u201cIsraeli-American attack\u201d, she summed up what much of the world sees. That Israel faces a catastrophic strategic defeat and reputational calamity is dawning on even its most ardent supporters; soon it will be widely understood that this applies to its western cheerleaders, too.\n\nThe west\u2019s decline long predates this current crime of historic proportions, but it is the radical right which has, to date, monopolised this conversation. For it, the explanations for the downfall are, variously, immigration, multiculturalism, Islam, \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cgender ideology\u201d, the disintegration of the nuclear family, and so on. Liz Truss\u2019s forthcoming book, Ten Years to Save the West, raging against a supposedly leftwing establishment blocking free-market innovation, is the latest addition to this genre. In fact, the explanation is really rather simple. In the aftermath of the Soviet collapse more than 30 years ago, western elites became intoxicated with a premature triumphalism. The hubris of the US neoconservative Midge Decter, speaking after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, sums it up well. \u201cIt\u2019s time to say: we\u2019ve won. Goodbye,\u201d she stated grandly.\n\nTwo conclusions were drawn from this perceived victory. One, that the model of unchained capitalism that had become dominant in the 1980s was the unimprovable end stage of human existence, boldly summed up by the US political scientist Francis Fukuyama\u2019s book The End of History and the Last Man. Two, that the US and its allies now had unchecked power and could behave as the world\u2019s police service. This was hubris, and inevitably, as anyone familiar with Greek tragedy knows, nemesis followed in its wake.\n\nResearch by Brown University suggests that about 4.5 million people died as a result of the post-9/11 wars\n\nThe global power of the US had taken a severe hit in the 1970s, when its standing was weakened by the humiliating sight of panicked US officials clambering on to helicopters in Saigon, sealing a final defeat in Vietnam. But its main rival, the Soviet Union, proved to be in a far more parlous state, and its collapse offered the west a chance to resurrect itself, with the first Gulf war and armed interventions in former Yugoslavia offered up as vindication for \u201cliberal interventionism\u201d. Then came the horror of 9/11 \u2013 and the ensuing military adventures that resulted in human catastrophe as well as humiliating failure. War in Afghanistan descended into a bloody quagmire, with the Taliban ending the drawn-out conflict more dominant than they had been at the start. The invasion of Iraq would \u201copen the gates of hell\u201d in the Middle East, warned the Arab League secretary-general Amr Moussa \u2013 and so it proved. Nato intervention in Libya\u2019s civil war ended in \u201cvictory\u201d, as Gaddafi was toppled. But at what cost? Libya is now a war-ravaged failed state.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just western military invincibility that has been shattered by these various escapades. The contempt shown for international law set a precedent other states knew they could follow, encouraging global disorder. Research by Brown University suggests that about 4.5 million people died as a result of the post-9/11 wars. The mass death these ventures brought about, and the accompanying human rights abuses typified by Guant\u00e1namo and Abu Ghraib, have ignited a justified contempt for western claims to moral superiority. Some, like Vladimir Putin, have sought to use this contempt as ammunition for their own aggression.\n\nAs well as its role in supporting Israel\u2019s massacre in Gaza, the west must reflect on how it fostered the conditions in which a Putin-like figure could emerge in Russia. The Putin regime, of course, bears responsibility for Russia\u2019s hideous invasion of Ukraine: the US isn\u2019t the only powerful state capable of violence and destruction. But is there not more to the story? Does the neoliberal economic model that western states exported to Russia not share some of the blame? That Putinism exploited Russian despair after the cold war is incontrovertible; but so is the fact that western states promoted \u201ceconomic shock therapy\u201d. This triggered a more severe crisis than the Great Depression, roaring hyperinflation, a drastic fall in life expectancy, and oligarchs pilfering the nation\u2019s wealth. Could a more stable, post-Soviet Russia have been inured from the revanchism of an authoritarian like Putin?\n\nThis disastrous economic model not only destabilised Russia, but paid untold damage to western, liberal democracies too. Such unrestrained capitalism directly paved the way for the 2008 financial crash, from which the west never truly recovered. Many of its countries then embarked on a ruinous course of austerity, which led to stagnation and decline, the ideal conditions for a rightwing authoritarian surge. The subsequent rise of Donald Trump\u2019s far-right movement now imperils the very future of US democracy. Everywhere, liberal democracy is in retreat, increasingly replaced by autocratic regimes such as in Hungary, which the European Union occasionally wrings its hands over but with little action to back it up. In most European countries the far right is surging, a worrying omen of the continent\u2019s future.\n\nThe triumphalism of western elites after the fall of the Berlin Wall was misplaced. Over three decades on, their hubris has proved disastrous, their wars and economic doctrine bringing blood, chaos and decline. Gaza is just the bloody culmination of the west\u2019s loss of legitimacy. Much of the world already had disdain for its moral claims, but there is no turning back this time. The moral collapse is now complete, as much of the Middle East and beyond brims with contempt for Israel\u2019s protectors.\n\nThings could have been different. There could have been accountability over previous foreign debacles: instead those responsible \u2013 from government ministers to hawkish newspaper commentators \u2013 walked from disaster to disaster, splattered with more and more blood, yet continued in their roles with their careers and reputations somehow intact. Meanwhile, rather than being treated with the respect those with insight deserve, the people who opposed these calamities at the time remain ostracised as fringe extremists or dupes of foreign enemies, despite being repeatedly vindicated.\n\nJust as we could have built an economic model that doesn\u2019t hoover up wealth into the bank accounts of the tiny elite, the lessons of the west\u2019s disastrous foreign policy history could have been heeded, and thus its catastrophic backing of Israel\u2019s Gaza assault avoided. Alas, it was not to be. You may have found these last years of turmoil exhausting. Buckle up: the fall of the west has several more acts to come.\n\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "content": "They did as much for the victories over Napoleon and Hitler as the regular army.\n\nVasilisa Kozhina\n\nAlexander Smirnov Alexander Smirnov\n\n\u201cShe was a woman of Herculean stature and great physical strength. She was beautiful in appearance and brave and decisive in character\u2026,\u201d was how contemporaries described one of the most celebrated heroines of the Patriotic War of 1812. Her name was Vasilisa Kozhina.\n\nVasilisa, a 35-year-old mother of five, had her first encounter with the horrors of war in mid-August when French forces plundered her native village in the Smolensk province and hacked her husband, village starosta [elder] Maksim Kozhin, to death.\n\nThe French returned nine days later, just as the wake for her husband was in progress. Vasilisa, elected starosta by the villagers, warmly welcomed the French and invited them to the table laid inside the house. When the soldiers got drunk, she ordered the windows and doors to be locked and the enemy to be burned alive.\n\nA partisan detachment organized and led by Kozhina followed hot on the heels of La Grande Arm\u00e9e, ruthlessly dispatching foragers, laggardly soldiers and looters. While her fighters soon exchanged their axes for sabers, lances and rifles, Vasilisa continued to fight with a pitchfork which she \u201cused with such force that a horse would fall dead from one blow\u201d.\n\nOnce, when Kozhina was escorting French prisoners, one of them openly started to express his displeasure at the fact that they were being escorted by a woman. Since the unruly soldier wouldn\u2019t quieten down, Vasilisa hacked him to death with a scythe, saying to the others: \u201cThe same fate will await all of you, you thieves and dogs, if you dare to put a foot wrong! I have already cut off the heads of 27 ruffians like you! March into town!\u201d\n\nWhat happened to Vasilisa Kozhina after the end of the Patriotic War is unknown. According to the most plausible accounts, she returned to her native village, where she died in around 1840.\n\nDenis Davydov\n\nGeorge Dawe/State Hermitage Museum George Dawe/State Hermitage Museum\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Denis Davydov was commander of the 1st Battalion of the Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment when Napoleon\u2019s army invaded Russia. In August 1812, he approached Pyotr Bagration, commander of the Second Western Army, with the idea of waging guerrilla warfare in the rear of the French forces and soon received Bagration\u2019s full support.\n\nDavydov was not the first and by no means the only commander of a partisan \u201cflying\u201d detachment in the Patriotic War of 1812. However, it was thanks to him that guerrilla warfare became widely known and gained wide popularity and the experience of such warfare was thoroughly documented and studied.\n\nIf Vasilisa Kozhina was a representative of a spontaneous popular partisan movement, Denis Davydov belonged to the so-called army guerrilla warfare category. For his first raid, he selected 50 hussars and 80 Cossacks from regular units. Later, the size of his detachment increased to 300 sabers.\n\nSince ordinary peasants often confused the uniforms of Russian hussars with French ones and mistook Davydov\u2019s detachment for enemy forces, he decided to completely change his image - he started wearing a Cossack caftan and grew a beard.\n\nIn mid-September, when Napoleon\u2019s army was preparing to enter Moscow, Davydov surprised a large detachment of French foragers in the rear of the French army near the village of Tsaryovo-Zaymishche and routed them. \u201cFear has large eyes and fear is inseparable from disorder. Everything crumbled as soon as we turned up: We captured some of them not only without their weapons, but even without their clothes; some were dragged out of the barns; only one rabble of thirty took it into their heads to defend themselves, but they were scattered and taken down on the spot. As a result of the raid, we ended up with 119 common soldiers, two officers, 10 wagons with provisions and one wagon with cartridges,\u201d Davydov wrote in \u2018Diary of Guerrilla Operations\u2019.\n\nOn November 7, Denis Davydov\u2019s detachment, along with other \u201cflying detachments\u201d, smashed a brigade commanded by Gen. Jean-Pierre Augereau in a battle near the village of Lyakhovo. The general himself and one-and-a-half thousand of his soldiers were taken prisoner by the Russians. \u201cThis victory was all the more notable in that, for the first time in the prosecution of the present campaign, an enemy corps laid down its arms to us,\u201d was how General-Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army, commented on the triumph.\n\nWith the Russian Army\u2019s crossing of the borders of the Russian Empire in January 1813 and the start of its foreign campaign, Davydov\u2019s daring cavalry raids in the rear of the enemy, by and large, came to an end. He began to operate more in conjunction with the main body of troops and was now in their advance guard.\n\nAfter the end of the war against Napoleon, Denis Vasilyevich spent another 20 years or so serving in the military. Aside from the army, his other great passion was poetry and he went down in history as the \u201cpartisan poet\u201d.\n\nKonstantin Chekhovich\n\nPublic Domain Public Domain\n\nAt precisely eight o\u2019clock in the evening on November 13, 1943, a powerful explosion rocked a cinema in the town of Porkhov in Pskov Region. It killed more than 700 Wehrmacht soldiers, 40 officers and two generals. The organizer and perpetrator of this massive act of sabotage was the cinema manager, who was additionally an active fighter of the 7th Leningrad partisan brigade. His name was Konstantin Chekhovich.\n\nAt the very beginning of the war, Konstantin Alexandrovich, the commander of a sapper platoon, was sent to the Leningrad area, where he was to carry out sabotage operations. Here he ended up in German captivity, from which he managed to escape after just two weeks. It was then that Chekhovich joined the partisans. Intending fully to utilize Chekhovich\u2019s professional skills, the command of the 7th Leningrad partisan brigade sent him to the town of Porkhov for a major sabotage operation.\n\nKonstantin Alexandrovich spent two years blending in with the locals in the town and gaining the confidence of the Germans: He became a family man and worked as a clock repairer and then as an electrician at the local power station. After getting a job at the cinema as a mechanic, he was subsequently promoted to manager.\n\nThe Porkhov cinema was chosen by the command of the partisan brigade as the main target of the operation. While German servicemen would gather on the ground floor to watch films, a branch of the German Security Service (SD) was located on the first floor.\n\nUsing his pockets and a small lunch bag, Chekhovich gradually smuggled 65 kg of TNT into the cinema premises, skilfully planting it around the perimeter of the building and installing a timer. His wife\u2019s sister Evgeniya Mikhaylova, who worked as a cleaner here, assisted him greatly in this.\n\nThe sabotage expert had calculated everything well: The blast came at the appointed time and the cinema building collapsed like a house of cards, burying under the debris the German servicemen who had gathered for the last film show of their lives. Both Konstantin Alexandrovich and his family were gone from the town by then.\n\nFor carrying out his mission, Chekhovich was put forward for the Hero of the Soviet Union title, but it was never awarded - his two-week period in German captivity was a factor. Only in 2013 was a commemorative plaque to him unveiled in the town of Porkhov.\n\nSidor Kovpak\n\nPublic Domain Public Domain\n\nWhen the German army invaded the Soviet Union, Sidor Artemyevich Kovpak had already turned 54. The last time he had wielded a weapon was during the Civil War and, in the intervening years, he had been mainly involved in civilian work. But this did not prevent him from becoming one of the most effective Soviet partisan commanders and principal organizers of the partisan movement in Ukraine in World War II.\n\nIn September 1941, Kovpak became leader of a small partisan detachment numbering scarcely more than ten men, hiding in the Spadshchansky Forest near the town of Putivl in northeast Ukraine. \u201cOur first dugout was built in such dense undergrowth that from a few dozen paces away you might not even find it. If you sat still there no German sniffer dog would ferret you out of that lair. But we hadn\u2019t gone to the woods to hide from the Germans, but to kill them, to give them not a moment\u2019s peace and to prevent them from playing the master in our own district. We were the masters here and we were intent on remaining the masters,\u201d he wrote in his memoirs titled \u2018From Putivl to the Carpathians\u2019.\n\nWithin a mere half-year, Kovpak\u2019s Putivl detachment had evolved into the Sumy partisan unit numbering around 1,500 fighters. The partisans under his command carried out daring raids to the rear of German and Hungarian troops, while contriving to extricate themselves from the most formidable traps set by the punitive forces sent out to catch them.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, Kovpak\u2019s unit was instructed to mount a large-scale raid on Western Ukrainian territory, which was subsequently to become widely known as the Carpathian Raid. Over a three-month period the partisans covered a distance of 2,000 km in the rear of the enemy, smashing up to 17 German garrisons, derailing 19 trains, destroying 51 depots and 52 bridges and also putting a number of power stations and oil fields out of action.\n\n\u201cOur arrival at the approaches to the Dniester was so unexpected to the Germans that they mistook the partisans for assault forces dropped by parachute. Detachments of gendarmerie began to rush around the roads. One such detachment ran into us near the town of Skalat. We had stopped here for a day\u2019s rest at the side of a wood. Deciding that they were dealing with a small detachment of Soviet paratroopers, the German gendarmes deployed in extended order and mounted a \u2018human wave\u2019 attack against the partisan formation which actually numbered around 2,000 fighters. We allowed those goons to approach so close that we were able to have a laugh as the expression on their faces instantly changed when the entire edge of the wood suddenly came to life and a tidal wave of partisans advanced to confront the enemy\u2026 The gendarmes got blown away in a split second,\u201d Kovpak recalled.\n\nIn late 1943, Sidor Artemyevich was forced by illness to hand over command to his deputy, Pyotr Vershigora, and to withdraw to territory controlled by the Red Army. In honor of its former commander, the Sumy partisan unit was soon afterwards renamed the 1st Ukrainian Partisan Division named after Twice Hero of the Soviet Union S.A. Kovpak.\n\nIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material.",

        "content": "MINSK, 12 April (BelTA) - There is no need for Belarus to participate in the hostilities today or ever, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said at a media scrum in the Kremlin, BelTA has learned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since the peace talks [on the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine] have not yet begun, how do you see the likelihood of Belarus having to join the hostilities?\" the journalists asked the head of state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't see it. There is no such need today or ever. I once said that Russia needs the peaceful, quiet, calm Belarus that does its job. I won't tell you in detail what we do and so on. We are \u2018co-aggressors\u2019, right?\u201d the president said. \u201cEveryone does their own thing. But I say it bluntly: neither I nor Putin (we discussed this problem yesterday) want the fraternal Ukrainian people to suffer. We don't want to!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this regard, Aleksandr Lukashenko touched on Russia's strikes on energy facilities in Ukraine, noting that this measure was a response to the attacks from the Ukrainian side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ukrainians should understand that if they target facilities such as oil refineries with their drones, the response will come instantly, but 10 times harder. Well, why provoke and fan this fire? Why do you need it? At the same time, they talk about some kind of peace talks and a conference in Switzerland. Without Russia, they want to ensure peace in Ukraine. Or without China. China is not going to send its representatives there either. Do these peace talks make sense then?\" the president said.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to the issue of Belarus' joining the hostilities, Aleksandr Lukashenko noted that Russia\u2019s \u201cflag-wavers\", as they are called in the Russian media, call for this sometimes. \"These calls urging Belarus to enter the war in Ukraine play into the hands of NATO. They are doing everything to drag us into a war with Ukraine,\" he stressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president explained that in this case, considering the border of Belarus with Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries, the length of the front will increase by thousands of kilometers: \"We will have to hold this front if we enter the war. Can we do it? We can't. I'm telling you: we can't. Do we want trouble for ourselves? We don't want to. That's the second thing. But what\u2019s the most important thing is that not only Russia might need the peaceful Belarus. Maybe Ukraine will need too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBelarus provides security on the borders in the Ukrainian and western directions.\n\n\n\n\u201cHalf the country is within a radius of 100 kilometers from Kiev, including Mozyr Oil Refinery, which, fortunately, operates without interruptions. You use the fuel that the refinery produces. Your and our self-exiled opposition (I have been recently briefed) are encouraging Poles and others to target Mozyr Oil Refinery. They say: \u2018It supplies fuel to the aggressor for military needs, among other things, which makes it a legitimate target\u2019,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko said. \u201cI told my military to deploy everything we have there to make sure our response will make them regret their decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we were to join the hostilities, it wouldn\u2019t change anything. They barricaded the border with Belarus up to rafters. Ukraine mined it and deployed 120,000 soldiers. Ukraine wants to send these troops to the front line and replace them with French troops. We are looking forward to seeing the French defend Ukraine. It is a complete joke! It's cheap talk. France will not send troops to defend Ukraine. They are trying to intimidate Putin and me. There is no need for Belarus to join the hostilities. Such statements are part of the same story about Putin and Lukashenko\u2019s intentions to invade Europe (Poland and the Baltics, for starters). This is utter nonsense. Putin said yesterday that it is a complete lie. We have never discussed this issue,\u201d the Belarusian leader said.\n\nAleksandr Lukashenko added that U.S. and German battalion tactical groups had been deployed in Poland and Lithuania near the Belarusian border. Belarus was forced to deploy its units in response.\n\n\u201cWe are standing face to face there. It would be the easiest thing for Belarus to join the hostilities. But Russia does not need it. It is important to sort things out at the front line,\u201d the head of state said.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine, according to a U.S. assessment.\n\nTwo senior Biden administration officials, who discussed the sensitive findings Friday on the condition of anonymity, said that in 2023 about 90% of Russia\u2019s microelectronics came from China, which Russia has used to make missiles, tanks and aircraft. Nearly 70% of Russia\u2019s approximately $900 million in machine tool imports in the last quarter of 2023 came from China.\n\nUS HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HEAD SAYS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CHINA, RUSSIA IS GREATEST THREAT SINCE WWII\n\nChinese and Russian entities have also been working to jointly produce unmanned aerial vehicles inside Russia, and Chinese companies are likely providing Russia with nitrocellulose used in the manufacture of ammunition, the officials said. China-based companies Wuhan Global Sensor Technology Co., Wuhan Tongsheng Technology Co. Ltd. and Hikvision are providing optical components for use in Russian tanks and armored vehicles.\n\nThe officials said Russia has received military optics for use in tanks and armored vehicles manufactured by Chinese firms iRay Technology and North China Research Institute of Electro-Optics, and China has been providing Russia with UAV engines and turbojet engines for cruise missiles.\n\nRussia\u2019s semiconductor imports from China jumped from $200 million in 2021 to over $500 million in 2022, according to Russian customs data analyzed by the Free Russia Foundation, a group that advocates for civil society development.\n\nBeijing is also working with Russia to improve its satellite and other space-based capabilities for use in Ukraine, a development the officials say could in the longer term increase the threat Russia poses across Europe. The officials, citing downgraded intelligence findings, said the U.S. has also determined that China is providing imagery to Russia for its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe officials discussed the findings as Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to China this month for talks. Blinken is scheduled to travel next week to the Group of 7 foreign ministers meeting in Capri, Italy, where he's expected to raise concerns about China's growing indirect support for Russia as Moscow revamps its military and looks to consolidate recent gains in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has previously raised his concerns directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping about Beijing indirectly supporting Russia\u2019s war effort.\n\nWhile China has not provided direct lethal military support for Russia, it has backed it diplomatically in blaming the West for provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to launch the war and refrained from calling it an invasion in deference to the Kremlin.\n\nChina has repeatedly said it isn\u2019t providing Russia with arms or military assistance, although it has maintained robust economic connections with Moscow, alongside India and other countries, amid sanctions from Washington and its allies.\n\n\"The normal trade between China and Russia should not be interfered or restricted,\" said Liu Pengyu, spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in Washington. \"We urge the U.S. side to refrain from disparaging and scapegoating the normal relationship between China and Russia.\"\n\nXi met in Beijing on Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who heaped praise on Xi's leadership.\n\nRussia\u2019s growing economic and diplomatic isolation has made it increasingly reliant on China, its former rival for leadership of the Communist bloc during the Cold War.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who returned to Washington this week from a visit to Beijing, said she warned Chinese officials that the Biden administration was prepared to sanction Chinese banks, companies and Beijing\u2019s leadership, if they assist Russia\u2019s armed forces with its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Democratic president issued an executive order in December giving Yellen the authority to sanction financial institutions that aided Russia\u2019s military-industrial complex.\n\n\"We continue to be concerned about the role that any firms, including those in the PRC, are playing in Russia\u2019s military procurement,\" Yellen told reporters, using the initials for the People's Republic of China. \"I stressed that companies, including those in the PRC, must not provide material support for Russia\u2019s war and that they will face significant consequences if they do. And I reinforced that any banks that facilitate significant transactions that channel military or dual-use goods to Russia\u2019s defense industrial base expose themselves to the risk of U.S. sanctions.\"\n\nThe U.S. has frequently downgraded and unveiled intelligence findings about Russia\u2019s plans and operations over the course of the more than 2-year-old war with Ukraine.\n\nSuch efforts have been focused on highlighting plans for Russian misinformation operations or to throw attention on Moscow\u2019s difficulties in prosecuting its war against Ukraine as well as its coordination with Iran and North Korea to supply it with badly needed weaponry. Blinken last year spotlighted intelligence that showed China was considering providing arms and ammunition to Russia.\n\nThe White House believes that the public airing of the intelligence findings has led China, at least for now, to hold off on directly arming Russia. China's economy has also been slow to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese officials could be sensitive to reaction from European capitals, which have maintained closer ties to Beijing even as the U.S.-China relationship has become more complicated.\n\nMeanwhile, China on Thursday announced rare sanctions against two U.S. defense companies over what it called their support for arms sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy Beijing claims as its own territory to be recovered by force if necessary.\n\nThe announcement freezes the assets of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems held within China. It also bars the companies\u2019 management from entering the country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFilings show General Dynamics operates a half-dozen Gulfstream and jet aviation services operations in China, which remains heavily reliant on foreign aerospace technology even as it attempts to build its own presence in the field.\n\nThe company also helps make the Abrams tank being purchased by Taiwan to replace outdated armor intended to deter or resist an invasion from China.\n\nGeneral Atomics produces the Predator and Reaper drones used by the U.S. military.",

It called them \"cruel\" and \"unconscionable\" and urged for them to stop.\n\nRescuers from Ukraine's State Emergencies Service DSNS often arrive to deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks before everyone else, and they also say the threat of repeat strikes is becoming ever more frequent.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the tactic of double-tapping has been used increasingly often recently. This is difficult to comprehend. The Russians have no right to do this,\" DSNS spokesman Oleksandr Khorunzhy told the BBC.\n\n\"They know perfectly well what they're doing, and not just to rescuers, police officers, utility workers or medics. This affects ordinary civilians,\" Mr Khorunzhy said.\n\nHe called double-taps \"utterly immoral\".\n\n\"I can't wrap my head around this, it's just inhuman,\" he said. \"They see perfectly well that unarmed rescuers are the first to arrive at the sites of their attacks.\"\n\nThe DSNS says 91 of its rescuers have been killed and more than 340 injured since the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nKira Oves was one of the journalists injured in the Zaporizhzhia double-tap attack.\n\nShe told the BBC that she had just arrived at the scene of a strike when she heard a whistling sound.\n\n\"A colleague shouted: Incoming!

        "content": "During the full-scale invasion, Russian troops have damaged or wholly destroyed at least 630 churches, prayer houses, and other religious facilities in Ukraine.\n\nThe Institute for Religious Freedom published this new data in the report \u201cThe Impact of the Russian Invasion on Faith-Based Communities in Ukraine.\u201d The IRF research contains the results of monitoring and surveys on the situation of Ukrainian religious communities in the territories occupied by Russia.\n\nThe report in English\n\nThe summary of the report in English\n\nThe report in Ukrainian\n\nIn addition, IRF recorded seventeen interviews with religious leaders of various denominations about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. These video testimonies are available for watching on YouTube with English subtitles.\n\nThe Kremlin uses religion, particularly Russian religious centers, as a tool of war against Ukraine. In addition to propagating hatred of Ukrainians, the Russian authorities in the occupied territories of Ukraine often practice arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, torture, and even murder of Ukrainian religious leaders. Those priests, pastors, imams, etc., who did not agree to collaborate and refused to submit to Russian religious centers are subject to repression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IRF report states that most damage was inflicted by Russian missiles, kamikaze drones, and artillery, including targeted attacks on civilian objects. In addition, some places of worship have been deliberately looted by the Russian military, closed, or converted by the occupying authorities into administrative buildings.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Russian Offensive Begins in Kharkiv Region An unnamed senior Ukrainian military source revealed that Russian forces aim to push Ukrainian troops back up to 10 km to establish a buffer zone, but Kyiv\u2019s forces are resisting.\n\nMost churches, prayer houses, synagogues, and mosques were destroyed in Donetsk region (at least 146), Luhansk region (at least 83), and Kherson region (at least 78). The destruction in Kyiv region, where Russian troops attempted to capture the capital of Ukraine in February-March 2022, was also enormous (73). Due to the ongoing hostilities, the number of destroyed buildings is increasing in Kharkiv region (at least 62), Zaporizhzhia region (at least 51), and Mykolaiv region (at least 41).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfographics: IRF Ukraine / irf.in.ua\n\nOn a confessional basis, Orthodox churches suffered most damage from the Russian aggression \u2013 at least 246 in total. Of these, the churches of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate) suffered the most \u2013 at least 187. Also, 59 churches of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine were destroyed or damaged.\n\nThe scale of destruction and looting of evangelical churches is also extensive \u2013 at least 206 in total. Among them, the Pentecostal (94), Baptist (60), and Seventh-day Adventist Church (27) prayer houses suffered the most.\n\nIt is most likely that if Russia retains control over the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions throughout 2024 and beyond, Ukrainian churches and religious communities in these regions will face the same fate as believers in the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions occupied since 2014. The Russian occupying authorities will continue to fight any manifestations of dissent, opposition, and Ukrainian identity, particularly religious identity, by enforcing repressive Russian legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHiding behind slogans of protecting Russian speakers, \u201cdenazification,\u201d and \u201cdesatanization\u201d of Ukraine, the Kremlin has actually been implementing the ideology of the \u201cRusskiy Mir\u201d (Russian World). As interpreted by Russian propagandists, this ideology comprises the physical destruction of the Ukrainian people as a nation (genocide), the elimination of Ukrainian cultural heritage, the overthrow of the Ukrainian government, and the disappearance of the Ukrainian state.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe IRF formulated several recommendations in the report. Among them are the following:\n\nTo publicly condemn the Russian World ideology and the position of the Russian Orthodox Church and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, as well as other Russian religious associations and leaders who participate in the Russian aggression and justify it or promote hatred and genocide of the people of Ukraine.\n\nTo strongly and proactively support Ukraine\u2019s efforts to investigate Russian war crimes and prosecute all war criminals.\n\nTo introduce personal sanctions against Russian officials, religious leaders, media workers, and other individuals responsible for justifying or carrying out repressions against Ukrainian religious leaders and faith-based communities on the Ukrainian territories controlled by Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo designate the Russian Federation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, considering the constant attacks on the civilian population and critical infrastructure of Ukraine, deliberate exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis, nuclear blackmail, the use of torture, inhuman treatment of prisoners of war, and arbitrarily imprisoned civilians, particularly religious figures.\n\nSee the original report by HRWF here.",

        "content": "The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, has said that Russia's top military leadership has tasked their troops with capturing the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region by May 9.\n\nThat's according to the Facebook page of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukrinform reports.\n\n\"I was working in another, very important and dangerous direction. The enemy is also concentrating efforts to break through our defenses west of Bakhmut, exit to the Siverskyi Donets - Donbas channel, capture the settlement of Chasiv Yar, and create conditions for further advance to the Kramatorsk agglomeration,\" Syrskyi said.\n\nHe emphasized that the heroic defense of the Ukrainian brigades prevents the Russians from implementing their plans.\n\n\"Using a numerical advantage and various motivational factors, including executions, separate groups of the enemy's infantry advanced to the Novyi neighborhood, but were destroyed by FPV kamikaze drone strikes and artillery fire,\" the general said.\n\nAt the same time, Syrskyi said, the threat remains relevant, given that Russia's top military leadership has tasked their troops with capturing Chasiv Yar by May 9.\n\n\"To respond adequately to the actions of the enemy and strengthen the defense of our troops in this direction, measures have been taken to significantly strengthen the brigades with ammunition, drones, and electronic warfare,\" the commander-in-chief said.\n\nAccording to him, the main conclusion from his two-day work at the front is the need to improve the quality of training, including the moral and psychological component, to increase the number of high-tech unmanned systems for various purposes with trained operators, and to improve the quality of conducting asymmetric operations to reduce the combat potential of the Russians.\n\n\"We continue to carry out organizational measures with an emphasis on increasing the efficiency of management, eliminating duplication, and directing freed resources to support combat units and sub-units. The main task of these measures is to increase the combat capability of our troops, save the lives of our soldiers, disrupt the enemy's plans, and ensure the training of reserves,\" Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi said on April 13 that the situation on the eastern front had worsened significantly in recent days.\n\nPhoto credit: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine",

        "content": "The news that Serbia sent Ukraine financial aid to the tune of $32.4 million in March did not provoke much interest in either country. Several Ukrainian portals reported this confirmation from the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance, pointing out how it was \u201cnoteworthy\u201d that the aid came from a country that i) maintains economic ties with Russia; and ii) did not join the EU's economic sanctions against Moscow.\n\nIs this friendly transaction between two governments worthy of greater media attention? It is certainly worthy of examining further to mitigate the issue of stereotyping.\n\nThe latest financial support for Ukraine is no small amount for Serbia. It is equal to the annual budget of one of its medium-sized cities, with about 60,000 inhabitants. It is also not unprecedented. Serbia in fact provided \u20ac3 million to Ukraine to help vulnerable children and another \u20ac1.5 million to displaced persons, just a few months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Along with financial aid, Serbia sent material aid, medical vehicles, electric generators, water purification plants, and other humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerbia is not part of the international coalition that supplies Ukraine with weapons and military materials. It has proclaimed neutrality in relation to the conflict, and its authorities repeat that Serbia does not supply weapons to any parties. However, there are convincing reports that Serbia still delivers weapons to Ukraine without interfering with the deliveries made through intermediary countries.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Official Responsible for Ukraine\u2019s National Recovery Removed Lawmakers in Ukraine\u2019s parliament have removed Oleksandr Kubrakov, one of several deputy prime ministers charged with overseeing national reconstruction.\n\nA year ago, Reuters published extracts from classified Pentagon documents, according to which Serbia agreed to supply arms to Kyiv or has sent them already. In the meantime, videos began to appear sporadically on (primarily Russian) social media accounts, mostly of artillery ammunition with labels of Serbian manufacturers allegedly used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nPolitical support\n\nHowever, Serbia's most convincing support for Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression \u2013 and often overlooked \u2013 is at the political level. This may surprise those who continue to label or stereotype Serbia as Russia's ally and therefore Ukraine's adversary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the first resolution of the UN General Assembly in March 2022, Serbia has consistently been among those countries that have condemned Russian aggression and demanded its immediate withdrawal from Ukraine. Serbia voted for four such resolutions in the UN, including the one condemning Russia's annexation of four eastern regions of Ukraine in October 2022. It was a big surprise to many too that Serbia in fact voted for the exclusion of Russia from the UN Human Rights Council in April 2022.\n\nSerbia\u2019s position in global forums regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine is identical to the one it takes in regional organizations. Together with nine other countries in southeast Europe, Serbia signed a declaration according to which Russian aggression against Ukraine was a flagrant violation of international law and the greatest threat to European security. Then, at a February summit in Tirana with President Volodymyr Zelensky, the leaders of the region pledged to continue supporting Ukraine until its victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don't understand people [in Serbia] who express anti-Ukraine sentiments. I understand their position on Russia. Ukraine has never done anything against Serbia. They are our Slavic brothers and we try to have good relations,\u201d said Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, one of the signatories of the regional declaration, in Tirana at the time.\n\nHis meetings with Zelensky have been frequent in the last year, and both consider them significant and friendly.\n\n\u201cI noted the importance of Serbia's participation in the implementation of the Peace Formula,\u201d Zelensky stated after their meeting in February, thanking Serbia for its support of Ukrainian sovereignty, the aid it provided, and the acceptance of Ukrainian refugees.\n\nSerbia did not impose economic sanctions on Russia. When it took that decision at the very start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it pointed out that it could change that decision when it affected its economic and political interests. However, the issue of sanctions has been at the center of the usual portrayal of Serbian positioning in favor of Russian aggression against Ukraine for too long, with less justification.\n\nFor Zelensky, it does not pose any problem to maintain constant and solid partnership communications with Serbian leader Vu\u010di\u0107. Serbia's political, humanitarian, financial, and quite possibly military support for Ukraine, is continuous and not at all symbolic. As such, it has long since put aside the fact that Serbia has not imposed economic sanctions on Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia\u2019s take on Serbia\u2019s position\n\nNot surprisingly, those who recognize the partnership and friendly essence of Serbia's relationship with Ukraine are in Moscow. While the Kremlin, in its official statements, continues to characterize Vu\u010di\u0107 as the leader of a friendly nation and a representative of partnership policy towards Russia (even though there were exceptions to this), its propaganda channels often attack him as an insincere partner, completely turned towards the West, and thus Ukraine.\n\nIn the latest such offensive review, Russian media described Vu\u010di\u0107's meeting with Emmanuel Macron in Paris earlier this week as humiliating. \u201cHe came to Paris to beg and did not have the strength to stand up to the head of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace,\u201d he Russian Gazette wrote about the Serbian-French summit, conveying, in fact, the Kremlin's sincere position about the Serbian president, one that they usually do not state themselves but leave to their controlled media.\n\nThe problem for Moscow is that the last of as many as 20 meetings between President Vu\u010di\u0107 and Macron will result in the purchase of 12 French Rafale fighter jets, which represent Serbia\u2019s final strategic shift away from the traditional attachment to Russian weapons inherited from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerbia and Ukraine do not have any problems with their mutual relations. These relations are several levels higher than an ordinary partnership. Most Serbian citizens are on the side of Russia on an emotional level, even when it invades the friendly people of Ukraine. This is a factor that no Serbian leader, not even Vu\u010di\u0107, could ignore when creating policies regarding this conflict.\n\nBut only a brief overview of Belgrade's official decisions regarding Ukraine, including the financial package of $32.4 million from last March, clearly shows where Serbia really stands.\n\nThe views expressed are the author\u2019s and not necessarily of Kyiv Post.",

        "content": "Why, under Paul I, were men not allowed to wear shoes with ribbons instead of bucklesand, under Peter I, to walk in shoes lined with iron nails? And what do bears and cats have to do with it?\n\n1. Do not wear shoes secured with nails\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nPeter the Great, as you may know, was a great entrepreneur. And he even took care of such prosaic things as the wooden sidewalks of St. Petersburg. To prevent them from wearing out quickly, in 1715, he issued a decree prohibiting walking in shoes lined with iron staples or nails. Violators faced harsh punishment: desperate fashionistas - heavy fines, while sellers - hard labor and confiscation of property. The reaction was lightning-fast: the streets were suddenly empty.\n\nYear later, a new decree followed, which obliged all home owners in St. Petersburg to pave a \u2018sazhen\u2019 (213 cm) of the street in front of them with stone.\n\n2. Sew buttons on the cuffs of uniforms\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nPeter I also ordered buttons to be sewn on the cuffs of uniforms. The reason is simple: he wanted to teach the military good manners and discourage them from wiping their mouths with their sleeve after eating, so as to not have to sew a new uniform so often.\n\n3. Drink no more than a glass\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nIn 1647, Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich declared war on alcoholism - first he banned alcohol in the Solovetsky Monastery and, a couple of years later, in all other monasteries. Four years after that, he carried out a pub reform: the tsar ordered the reduction of the number of drinking outlets. At the same time, prices for alcohol increased threefold: it was impossible to sell it on credit and no more than one glass per person was sold - about 150 milliliters. In addition, it was prohibited to trade during fasting and on Sundays: in total, there were 180 of such \"sober\" days on the calendar! By the way, those who produced \u201cunderground\u201d vodka faced serious punishment: from fines for those who were caught for the first time, to whipping and prison for such malicious manufacturers of counterfeit goods.\n\n4. Don\u2019t wear round hats or dance the waltz\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nAnother master of strange laws was Paul I. He decided to fight everything that could be reminiscent of the French Revolution and cause freethinking. The result was a decent list: women could not decorate their dresses with colored ribbons over the shoulder, men could only wear cocked and round hats, while wide-brimmed French hats were outlawed. And, along with them - shoes with ribbons instead of buckles, sideburns and even the waltz. Rumors connected these wild prohibitions with the problems of the emperor himself: his beard did not grow very well and he was not a very agile dancer.\n\n5. Do not export rhubarb\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nIn the 17th century, rhubarb was brought to Moscow from China: it was used as a medicine for stomach disorders and as a dye that gave a golden hue. This herb was highly valued: a \u2018pood\u2019 (about 16 kg) cost 40 rubles! The same price as, for example, a \u2018pood\u2019 of good silk. It was forbidden to trade rhubarb: the main and only buyer and seller was the tsar's treasury. At the end of the 17th century, it could not be exported from Siberia, under Empresses Anna Ioanovna and Elizabeth Petrovna, rhubarb became a \"commodity for state profit\". \"Siberian gold\" could not be bought by private individuals and the treasury kept very high prices on it. Violators faced serious punishment, including \"the most severe torture\".\n\n6. Wearing shaggy wigs\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nSome decrees were born not out of economic or political considerations, but solely from a sense of beauty. For example, the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, a great fashionista, once used a poor-quality powder that tightly glued her hair together. Coloring in black also did not help to hide the traces of an unsuccessful experiment. The empress almost completely cut her hair and began wearing a wig.\n\nAnd, at the same time, she ordered all the ladies of the court to do the same: they had to deprive themselves of their hair and wear black wigs, like her.\n\n7. Send cats to the court\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nIn October 1745, Empress Elizabeth Petrovna issued perhaps the sweetest decree - \u2018On the expulsion of cats\u2019. It said: \"Having found the best and largest cats in Kazan from the local breeds, suitable for catching mice, send them to St. Petersburg to the court of Her Imperial Majesty.\" Since then, the rat-catching cats have settled in the Winter Palace.\n\n8. Do not drive bears in the streets\n\nKira Lisitskaya Kira Lisitskaya\n\nBear trade existed in Russia for a long time: bears were taught various tricks and performed with them at fairs, to the admiration of the public. Bears performed up to several dozens of different commands and staged entire performances, portraying a girl at a mirror, a soldier with a gun, a peasant who had gone on a bender and many others. In 1865, the Society for the Protection of Animals appeared in Russia, which began to save the bears. Two years later, Alexander II signed a decree banning bear hunting.\n\nDear readers,\n\nOur website and social media accounts are under threat of being restricted or banned, due to the current circumstances.

        "content": "Less than a week after the start of Russia\u2019s February 2022 full-scale of invasion of Ukraine peace talks began as, even then, it was clear that Putin\u2019s boast to be \u201cin Kyiv in three days\u201d wasn\u2019t going to happen. There then began several rounds of intense negotiation between Moscow, Kyiv, and several others that could have stopped the war virtually before it had begun.\n\nThe US international relations journal and think tank, Foreign Affairs, has acquired copies of the various draft versions of a peace treaty. They show how the discussions progressed and how the text of the treaties changed until eventually they reached a point where insurmountable differences stopped the process.\n\nThe negotiating processes.\n\nThe first round of talks, which lasted more than five hours, was facilitated by President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and was held in the Gomel region of Belarus on Feb. 28. Three days later they met again in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, also in Belarus. These talks resulted in an agreement to establish humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the third round of talks on March 7, in the Brest region, also in Belarus the two sides laid out their \u201cred lines\u201d for peace, at which point it was becoming obvious that there was unlikely to be a meeting of minds on the subject.\n\nAccording to the New York Times Kyiv demanded that Russians be held accountable for war crimes, its forces needed to withdraw from all occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and agree to pay financial reparations.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Scholz Urges More Ukrainian Refugees in Germany to Take Up Work Germany is the EU country that has taken in the most Ukrainian refugees, about a third of the total. However, only about 18% were employed in January 2024, one of the lowest rates in the OECD.\n\nIn its turn Moscow insisted that Ukraine should recognize its 2014 annexation of Crimea, declare its permanent neutrality, and agree to autonomy for the ethnic Russian areas of eastern and southeastern Ukraine.\n\nDespite the lack of progress both sides agreed to continue talking and to include representatives of their presidential administrations, foreign and defense ministries in the future. Kyiv did signal that it was willing to consider Russia\u2019s demand for military neutrality if, in turn, Moscow accepted Kyiv\u2019s future membership in the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 10 Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmitry Kuleba, met on the sidelines of a diplomatic forum in Antalya, Turkey for a one-and-a-half-hour meeting chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. The main agenda item was to agree on a temporary cease-fire in Mariupol and other areas of intense fighting, to allow civilian evacuation.\n\nAgain, there was no progress primarily, according to Kuleba, because \u201cunfortunately, Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit to anything\u201d without the agreement of Putin. Russia said it was because Ukraine wanted to go back on issues agreed during the meetings in Belarus. Cavusoglu seemed to think there had been progress in his comments to Turkish media.\n\nFurther talks, held via video conferencing between March 13 and 17, seemed to offer real hope of a breakthrough. On March 15, President Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been \u201creal progress\u201d and Lavrov spoke of some hope for reaching a \u201ccompromise.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times said a 15-point draft deal had been prepared wherein Kyiv would give up its NATO ambitions in return for security guarantees outside NATO. Ukraine detected a softening of Russia\u2019s demands which Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak attributed to a reflection of how badly Putin\u2019s \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d invasion was going which left him with \u201cno chances whatsoever to move further into Ukraine territory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time of the sixth round of negotiations on March 21, the air of optimism was beginning to wane. Zelensky requested a face-to-face meeting with Putin which was rejected as it \u201cshould happen once the two sides are closer to agreeing on key issues.\u201d The resulting temporary halt to negotiations caused by this snub coincided with Ukraine\u2019s March 22 counteroffensive which by April 3 had ended the Russian threat to Kyiv.\n\nMarch 29, the seventh round of talks was held face-to-face in Istanbul during which a draft peace treaty began to take real shape. In return for permanent Ukrainian neutrality and non-nuclear status, it would receive security guarantees, described by some as \u201cNATO Article 5 Lite,\u201d underwritten by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Belarus (Russia\u2019s nomination) Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland and Turkey (Ukraine\u2019s choice).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Russia would agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, and Ukraine would reserve the right to take back the occupied Luhansk and Donetsk regions. It also clearly stated that all guarantors (including Russia), \u201cconfirm their intention to facilitate Ukraine\u2019s accession to the European Union.\u201d\n\nRussia also agreed to voluntarily reduce its military activity that threatened Kyiv to \u201ccreate the necessary conditions for further negotiations.\u201d The fact that Ukraine\u2019s week-old counteroffensive had already forced Russian forces a long way back from the capital suggested the Russian offer was hardly voluntary.\n\nPutin called the March 29 draft a \u201cnot bad result\u201d and indicated he was now prepared to meet Zelensky. The discussions ended with the expectation that the draft treaty laid down firm foundations for an end to the war and it was only the fine details that needed to be settled.\n\nAs the Ukrainians pushed Russian forces back from Kyiv revealing the atrocities committed by Moscow\u2019s troops in Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in the Kyiv region, negotiations continued.\n\nForeign Affairs quoted the then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who had been one of the mediators between Moscow and Kyiv, more than 15 drafts were prepared between March 29 and April 15, with this last version proposing to sign the final agreement by the end of the month.\n\nHow did success turn to failure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cnot-so-simple truth\u201d according to many including, significantly, Putin himself, was that Ukraine walked away from the deal because of pressure from the West and the poor performance of Russian forces led Kyiv to believe they would win the war.\n\nOthers said that the talks were just a sham with both sides merely going through the motions because that was what the international community expected. Russia\u2019s Putin-led views were too fundamental to accept anything other than victory, and each side was merely buying time to see how the war went.\n\nIt was suggested that although Ukraine said it was willing to renounce NATO membership, it did not trust the principle of third-party security guarantees because of the failure of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, by which Kyiv gave up its nuclear deterrent in return for security guarantees by among others the US and Russia, as well as the Minsk agreements which were supposed to have ended the post-2014 fighting in the Donbas.\n\nTo many it was obvious that there was no way Russia would ever voluntarily give up the annexed territories of Crimea and the Donbas. It was only the initial failure of the invasion that brought Moscow to the negotiating table while the success of Ukrainian forces not only persuaded Kyiv it could win but also gave impetus to Western allies to provide support to the \u201cwinning side.\u201d That combination also finally persuaded Kyiv that it no longer needed to make concessions \u2013 a view which further successes in the summer of 2022 only reinforced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Foreign Affairs publication quoted commentators who thought the whole basis of the negotiations was off beam. They say if the dialog had been truly meaningful it should have concentrated on conducting a cease-fire, de-escalation and protecting the civilian population. In fact, the whole basis of the discussions on both sides had been in trying to agree a post-war order when the outcome of the war was always in doubt. As the publication says: \u201cputting the cart of the post-war order before the horse of the end of the war.\u201d\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nThere has been little change in the views of either side, both seeing the only way forward being a military victory over the other. Many believe that, with the military situation becoming effectively deadlocked, the time is ripe to renew peace talks. There have been reports of \u201csecret talks\u201d between US and Russian officials and publicly voiced peace initiatives by Ukraine itself as well as China, the Vatican, Brazil, Mexico and others. The consensus is that after more than two years the war is going nowhere and, eventually, someone will lose patience and nuclear escalation will be the probable outcome.\n\nThe bottom line is surely that every war eventually ends in negotiation and compromise. The April 15 draft or something very similar seems as good a starting point as anything suggested so far. The big question is just how much is either side prepared to give and reduce its demands on the other to end this ultimately pointless war.\n\nWill Ukraine cede some of the territory it has already lost, and will Russia be prepared to give some back?\n\nWill Ukraine give up its desire for NATO membership or will Russia accept that joining the alliance is not the existential threat its public pronouncements suggest?\n\nWill both Ukraine and Russia truly believe that the external security guarantees Kyiv has signed with the G7 nations and others are worth the paper they are written on?\n\nWill peace lead to Russia re-entering the international community and the ending of economic and political sanctions or will Kyiv and others insist on some form of wide-ranging punishment including reparations for Ukraine being exacted on the Kremlin?",

The Belgian depository is being ring fenced now as \u201csystemic - with the argument going that we cannot go after Russian assets there as it might risk a run on the euro or legal action by Moscow which could risk the stability of the Belgian based depository.\n\nBoth arguments appear more like scaremongering (bollox actually - excuse my French or Flemish) and indeed if Euroclear was so systemically important then it could be indemnified against any future lawsuits by Moscow by the EU. I would argue that the defeat of Ukraine by Russia, which would send Red Army tanks West again, is a much bigger and more likely systemic risk to Europe, and the euro, if we don\u2019t secure Ukraine\u2019s war time financing with the use of immobilized Russian assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs yet the IMF\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up and I just doubt the long-term commitment by Western taxpayers to spend $100 billion a year to keep Ukraine in the war - actually we are already failing here as reflected in ammo shortages now on the front line. The only assured source of long-term financing is from immobilized Russian assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the IMF is asking private creditors - pensioners - to stump up a $14.8 billion financing contribution to Ukraine via a new debt treatment. All well and good (creditors have already halted debt service payments to August 2024 and in a worst case scenario likely will extend that service halt to run in parallel to the Paris Club service suspension to 2027 - which will get close to the $14.8 billion financing contribution anyway) but how about first/also getting Belgium to stump up the EUR6-7 billion in interest earned on immobilized Russian assets.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Scholz Urges More Ukrainian Refugees in Germany to Take Up Work Germany is the EU country that has taken in the most Ukrainian refugees, about a third of the total. However, only about 18% were employed in January 2024, one of the lowest rates in the OECD.\n\nAs yet, the EU is only talking about utilizing the interest earned on these assets from 2024. Why? It is beyond me why Belgium gets to profiteer from the war by keeping the earnings from 2022-23. And how about Euroclear contributing the profits made on its business managing Russian central bank reserves way back in time when it was already clear that Russia was a fascist state acting in a malign manner against the West. How far back?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps 2008 and the invasion of Georgia, the poisoning of Litvinenko or Skrypal, or 2014 and the annexation of Crimea, and the first Russian invasion of Donbas - does Euroclear do ESG? I wonder.\n\nThe IMF talks about burden sharing, but at the moment I only see Western taxpayers and creditors (pensioners paying) doing this so how about Russian taxpayers, Belgium, and Euroclear helping share the burden a bit?\n\nReprinted from the author\u2019s @tashecon blog!

        "content": "It turns out that in the country of wooden churches and Russian-style \u2018terems\u2019 (fairytale houses), there are more than 2,000 buildings built in a seemingly \u201calien\u201d European style, the Gothic.\n\n1. The Kaliningrad Cathedral\n\nLegion Media Legion Media\n\nIn Kaliningrad Region, original medieval Gothic churches, rather than the neo-Gothic stylizations built later, have been preserved. This is because, before World War II, it was the territory of Germany and Prussia. One of them is the K\u00f6nigsberg (as the city used to be called) Cathedral, which opened its doors in 1380.\n\n\n\n2. Tsaritsyno Palace in Moscow\n\nLegion Media Legion Media\n\nThis palace ensemble for German-born Empress Catherine the Great was designed in the late 18th century by court architect Vasily Bazhenov. She wanted it to be built in the \"Gothic taste\". However, for various reasons, the construction wasn't completed. At the turn of the 21st century the palace was restored and now houses an exhibition complex.\n\n3. The Chesme church in St. Petersburg\n\nA. Savin, WikiCommons A. Savin, WikiCommons\n\nWe owe the appearance of this Gothic chapel near the Tsarskoye Selo imperial residence to Catherine the Great, as well. The empress ordered the construction of the church in honor of the Russian fleet\u2019s victory over the Turkish fleet in the Chesme Battle of 1770.\n\n\n\n4. Gothic capella in Peterhof\n\nKalabiYau (CC BY-SA 3.0) KalabiYau (CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nNicholas I, the grandson of Catherine the Great, was a great Germanophile, not only because of his grandmother, but also because of his wife, a German princess. He ordered the construction of a house church in the Alexandria Park in Peterhof. The chapel resembles a miniature Gothic cathedral and is consecrated in honor of St. Alexander Nevsky.\n\n5. Vladimir Church in Bykovo, Moscow Region\n\nPavel Kuzmichev Pavel Kuzmichev\n\nThis church literally resembles a Disney castle! Senator and Moscow Governor Mikhail Izmailov built it on the territory of his estate in the 1780s. Presumably, famous court architect Vasily Bazhenov was behind the project.\n\n6. Princess Oldenburg's Palace in Voronezh Region\n\nDarya Apasova (CC BY-SA 4.0) Darya Apasova (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nThe German-born princes of Oldenburg built their manor house in the village of Ramon in the neo-Gothic \u2018Old English\u2019 style in the 1880s. This castle is now one of the main attractions near Voronezh.\n\n\n\n7. Nicholas church of Mozhaisk kremlin\n\nLudvig14 (CC BY-SA 4.0) Ludvig14 (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nThis church was built in the early 19th century in the ancient Mozhaisk Kremlin near Moscow. Architect Alexei Bakarev combined the typical Russian church structure with Gothic decorative elements so successfully that he was commissioned to rebuild the Moscow Kremlin\u2019s Nikolskaya Tower in the Gothic style.\n\n8. Spasskaya and Nikolskaya Towers of the Moscow Kremlin\n\nMilan Nykodym; Ludvig14 (CC BY-SA 4.0) Milan Nykodym; Ludvig14 (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nAll the Moscow Kremlin towers were built by Italian architects in the late 15th century, but then, some of them underwent significant changes. For example, in the 1620s, English architect Christopher Galoway added a tiered Gothic top over the Spasskaya Tower. In the early 19th century, the Nikolskaya Tower was completely rebuilt in the Gothic style by Swiss architect Luigi Ruska and the aforementioned Russian Alexei Bakarev.\n\n9. Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary in Moscow\n\nLegion Media Legion Media\n\nThe Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow was built in the early 20th century in the Neo-Gothic style. During the Soviet era, it served as a dormitory and even a warehouse. But now, services are held there once again and it is considered the largest Catholic cathedral in Russia.\n\n10. Transfiguration Church in Krasnoyarsk\n\nLegion Media Legion Media\n\nThe Gothic style reached Siberia, as well. A Catholic church in Krasnoyarsk was built with donated money and finished in 1911. A wooden Catholic church used to stand in place of the new one. The Transfiguration Church can fit up to 1,000 worshipers and has a large organ. In Soviet times, this building with excellent acoustics was used as a recording studio by a radio committee.\n\nDear readers,\n\nOur website and social media accounts are under threat of being restricted or banned, due to the current circumstances.

In a word, Crimea will celebrate Victory Day with dignity,\u201d said Aksyonov.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parade was likely canceled due to frequent Ukrainian strikes on occupied Crimea, which severely crippled Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet; However, it is also possible that there\u2019s a lack of weapon to be displayed on the parade as most were likely sent to the front.\n\nIn 2023, only one tank \u2013 an antique T-34-85 unit produced in 1944-1946 \u2013 went on display on Red Square during the Victory Day parade, as opposed to the grandiose show of modern weaponry prior to Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Who Is Andrey Belousov, Russia\u2019s New Defense Minister? Russia\u2019s defense ministry is now under the command of a career bureaucrat and economist with no military background \u2013 but for Putin, he might be the right man for the job.\n\nUkraine celebrated Victory Day on May 9 up until 2013 as per the Soviet tradition, prior to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It was then changed to Victory Day over Nazism in World War II in a bid to distance itself from the Soviet regime.\n\nMany other nations involved in defeating Nazi Germany, including the US, UK and Canada in 1945 called May 9 V-E (Victory-Europe) day since, along with Australia and China, they continued the fight against the Axis, officially ending World War II on Sept. 2, 1945, with V-J (Victory Over Japan) day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2023, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to declare the day Europe Day instead, a day celebrating \u201cpeace and unity in Europe\u201d by the EU.",

However, it is an evident falsehood and a deception heavily promoted and oft-repeated by Russian officials and its benighted supporters.\n\nThe logical conclusion would be to take Pope Francis\u2019s advice and grasp the opportunity to wave a white flag and negotiate a cease-fire at any cost. After all, if Ukraine cannot defeat Russia, then the sooner the fighting ends, the less damage and loss of life. This is a narrative that needs to be critically examined, considering the influence of Russian propganda in shaping public opimiom.\n\nIn his \u201cArt of War,\u201d Sun Tzu, the legendary Chinese military strategist, famously stated that \u201call warfare is based on deception.\u201d He then noted: \u201cOne need not destroy one\u2019s enemy. One needs only destroy his willingness to engage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPromoting the fiction of Russian undefeatability is one of Russia\u2019s most potent deceptions in destroying a \u201cwillingness to engage.\u201d However, even a cursory review of Russia\u2019s military successes in modern times would find little support for that assumption. Its military success record has been dismal, and even its occasional \u201cvictory\u201d has been that of a thug and braggart rather than an equally matched or severe adversary.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Scholz Urges More Ukrainian Refugees in Germany to Take Up Work Germany is the EU country that has taken in the most Ukrainian refugees, about a third of the total. However, only about 18% were employed in January 2024, one of the lowest rates in the OECD.\n\nLet\u2019s consider its record from the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n1 .

World War II \u2013 Paris Peace Treaty (1947) and Treaty of San Francisco (1951). Notwithstanding Russia\u2019s self-glorifying \u201cvictory\u201d over Nazi Germany, the issue is more complex and nuanced. World War II was won by a \u201cGrand Alliance\u201d of 30 nations (including Russia) against eight \u201cAxis\u201d nations in Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union\u2019s role was limited to fighting only against Germany and only along Germany\u2019s eastern Front. Although much of the fiercest fighting and casualties were on that Front, the Germans could not risk diverting more than 20% of their military manpower from other theaters of the war. Furthermore, the Soviet Union benefited greatly from the approximately $200 billion (in current U.S. dollars) of American \u201cLend Lease\u201d and supplies from England and the other allies. Although Putin credits Russia with winning the war against Germany, the credit belongs to the Allied Powers, of which the Soviet Union played a part. Without Allied support and participation, the outcome would likely have been different. Advertisement\n\n\u2013 Paris Peace Treaty (1947) and Treaty of San Francisco (1951).

Russo-Ukrainian War \u2013 After Russia\u2019s 2014 occupation of Crimea and part of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas, Ukraine remains steadfast in its commitment to recovering all its territory. Despite the enormous asymmetry between the two nations, the daily trench warfare continues into its tenth year \u2013 more than twice as long as that of World War I.\n\nOut of the nine wars in which Russia has participated in modern times, it can claim only two clear victories: the occupation of Poland jointly with Nazi Germany and the suppression of Chechnya after defeat in its first invasion. Four of its wars have been clear defeats.\n\nThe Russo-Finnish War) was a partial success only in that Russia had to settle for land acquisition and abandon its dream of restoring Finland to Russia\u2019s imperial holdings. Its World War II battles on Nazi Germany\u2019s eastern front succeeded only as part of a collective effort by a 30-nation alliance. Its most recent war \u2013 with Ukraine \u2013 is still, after ten years, undetermined.\n\nHistory \u2013 and facts on the ground \u2013 have demonstrated that Russia is very \u201cdefeatable\u201d as long as its opponent is determined to hold out. No one should expect a railroad-style capitulation such as Germany\u2019s signing of the Treaty of Versailles or Vladimir Lenin\u2019s grudging acceptance of the Treaty of Brest Litovsk in World War I. It is unlikely that either Ukraine or Russia will ever agree to such a \u201ccapitulation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, assuming that Russia cannot be defeated despite its vastly greater population and resources is wrong. It has been \u201cdefeated\u201d many times in the wars in which it has engaged,\n\nSo, we should not fall prey to thinking and accepting assumptions that weakens our resolve to fight and win. Let us take heed of Sun Tzu\u2019s wise counsel from his grave: Ukrainians need not destroy their enemy. They need only destroy his willingness to engage.\n\nThe views expressed are the author\u2019s and not necessarily of Kyiv Post",

In 1754, a banana seedling was delivered to Count Peter Shuvalov's greenhouse in St. Petersburg from Europe. A year later, the plant had reached two and a half meters and bore several fruits.\n\nSoon, the plant found its place in the tsar's gardens. Its valuable fruits arrived on the table of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna. The nobility tried to follow the example of the reigning persons and also started growing bananas, but not so effectively - the fruits were never seen. In the next 100 years, bananas would remain a curiosity, even for the aristocracy.\n\nReproduction of \"Pineapples and Bananas\" painting. Ilya Mashkov, State Tretyakov Gallery. 1938. Sputnik Sputnik\n\nRecords have been preserved about how, in the middle of the 19th century, writer Ivan Goncharov saw an unusual fruit in Madeira during his travels. Having learned that they were bananas, he wanted to try them and was disappointed. He recorded his impressions in his book \u2018Frigate Pallada\u2019: \"I tried it - I didn't like it: it is bland, partly sweet, but sluggish and cloying, the taste is floury, it looks a bit like both potato and melon, only not as sweet as melon and without flavor or with its own, somehow coarse bouquet. It is rather a vegetable than a fruit and, among fruits, it is a \u2018parvenu\u2019 (\u2018upstart\u2019).\"\n\nNevertheless, at the beginning of the 20th century, bananas became available to ordinary citizens of St. Petersburg - they began to be brought in large quantities on steamships with refrigerators from the Americas and Europe. As a consequence, their prices became reasonable and St. Petersburg restaurants began to experiment with bananas - for example, \u2018banana punch\u2019 appeared.\n\nDuring the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the World Wars of the 20th century, Soviet citizens did not care about overseas bananas, but, after World War II, they, again, grew in popularity and began to be imported from China and Vietnam. Vietnamese bananas came to the USSR in exchange for military supplies and financial aid. They were brought in green and unripe and then allowed to rest so that they turned yellow. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was known to be a great fan of them. Bananas were also given to close officials and advanced workers as a reward for their labor.\n\nBoys with bananas from Guinea on Potemkin stairs 1961-1964. Sigismund Kropivnitsky/ MAMM/ MDF\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, due to the Vietnam War and deteriorating relations with China, banana shipments from Asia stopped. They were replaced under Leonid Brezhnev in the 1970s-1980s by bananas from Guinea and Ecuador. They were not so expensive anymore, but they were still exotic and huge waiting lines appeared in Moscow and St. Petersburg for them.\n\nHeroes of the movie 'Starik Hottabych' with artificial green bananas. 1956 Gennady Kazansky/Lenfilm Gennady Kazansky/Lenfilm\n\nBefore perestroika, imports of exotic fruits were exempted from customs duties, which contributed to even greater price reductions and market saturation. Today, bananas can be bought in any store in Russia.\n\nBananas for sale at the discount store.

The US, the UK and France, as well as Jordan, participated in Israel\u2019s defence.\n\nI arrived in Kyiv the following day. The contrast between the two emergencies could not be starker. Unlike Israel, Ukraine lacks sufficient air defences, and the west provides far less than it could or should to defend Ukraine against Russia. Ukraine is not dealing with one-off retaliation for striking a Russian consulate \u2013 as Israel is with Iran. Russia has been waging a war of aggression against Ukraine since 2014, aimed at eradicating its nationhood.\n\nDaily, Russian missiles and drones pummel Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure. A recent missile attack on a power generation plant in the north means that hundreds of thousands, if not a million more Ukrainians could be forced to leave their homes by next winter. Unable to occupy what is an unoccupiable country, Russia has decided it wants to make Ukrainian cities uninhabitable. Already the numbers are horrifying: before Russia\u2019s full-scale land invasion in 2022, Ukraine had a population of around 40 million. Today, just over 20 million live in free Ukraine, and that number could decline further in the months ahead.\n\nRussia is also making headway along the frontline, outmatching Ukraine in terms of artillery and manpower by a staggering 7:1 ratio, if not more. Now that the US House of Representatives has finally passed a long-awaited package of military aid worth $61bn for Ukraine after months of stalling, it could hold the line, perhaps losing some more territory in the Donetsk region. Final sign-off for the bill by Joe Biden is expected within days. In the worst case scenario, 2024 could see the fall of other major cities and towns such as Kharkiv, Sumy or Zaporizhzhia.\n\nMaking a state and a society function with a halved population, while fending off an invasion by one of the world\u2019s largest armies, requires unimaginable resilience. From what I could see over the course of a few days in the capital, Kyiv bustles with life. But it is life punctuated by almost daily air-raid sirens.\n\nAlong with a group from the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations I was on the way to the train station one day when our app alerts went off. There was no bunker for us to take refuge in, but our taxi driver shrugged, unflustered. There was no point in panicking, he said, we would reach the station soon and perhaps it would be over by then anyway. He was right; no sooner had we reached the station than Luke Skywalker\u2019s voice on our app thundered: \u201cThe air alert is over, may the Force be with you.\u201d\n\nFor Ukrainians to keep believing the Force is with them is hard enough. Doing so with one hand tied behind their back because of insufficient western support is next to impossible.\n\nIn some respects, the west is facing objective difficulty. It took Europe and the US almost two years to wake up to the fact that this would be a long war and that delivering part of their old weapon stocks would be insufficient. For two years (and more), Russia has put its economy on a war footing, while acquiring weapons from North Korea and Iran. The discrepancy in the ratios of artillery and ammunition are a reflection of this. Belatedly, the realisation of a long war has dawned on the west, and arms production is being ramped up: by next year, European governments should be able to compensate for some of the current mismatch. This is why Ukrainians perceive the coming months as their greatest window of vulnerability, perhaps greater than the first dramatic weeks after 24 February 2022.\n\nBut in other respects, European countries (and the US) have no excuses. Paradoxically, while lacking enough basic artillery and ammunition, Europe has no shortage of sophisticated air defence systems. There are approximately 100 such systems across Europe collecting dust. Important as the defence goal of deterring some future Russian aggression may be, the European continent is already at war. If European air defence systems continue lying around rather than being provided to Kyiv to save lives in Ukraine, they may end up being needed where they are currently stationed, turning the reasons against their transfer to Ukraine into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nUkraine doesn\u2019t need 100 Patriot and SAMP/T air defence systems; it just needs seven. But so far, with the exception of Germany, European countries have balked. They have come up with all sorts of reasons (or excuses), including the need to respect Nato standards. Yet many don\u2019t seem to have the same concern for breaking Nato standards on the target of 2% defence spending. If Germany can agree to send an additional Patriot battery to Ukraine despite having resisted vigorously, other European countries can follow suit. Not doing so now is simply unpardonable.\n\nIt is worth asking ourselves what explains this western reticence on Ukraine, especially given the stark contrast with the Middle East. There are two possible answers, neither of which is edifying. The first and bluntest is fear. The west has been pulling its punches in the Russia-Ukraine war because it is scared of Russia and Russian escalation. The more it has manifested its fear, the more it has galvanised Russia. Vladimir Putin smells fear, and like any fighter in a ring he is seizing the opportunity to double down. The Ukraine war has become existential for the Russian regime, and Ukraine\u2019s window of vulnerability may not last for ever. Therefore, best dig the knife in as deep as possible now that the west has immobilised itself in fear.\n\nThe second and most tragic reason is that Europe does not yet regard Ukraine as part of itself. As a colleague in Kyiv put it: \u201cEurope still considers us its \u2018good other\u2019.\u201d So long as that othering persists, Ukraine\u2019s existence will be in danger, and with it the security of the entire European continent. Showing that Ukraine is part of \u201cus\u201d means sending more of \u201cour\u201d air defences to protect Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. And it means approving Ukraine\u2019s EU accession negotiations framework and holding the first intergovernmental conference opening Ukraine\u2019s accession talks in June.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But then, ancient medicine recipes came to their aid.\n\nHow 18th-century medicine helped save besieged Leningrad\n\nIn those difficult times of war, when there was a shortage of medicines in the city\u2019s hospitals and clinics. Doctors had to get by as best they could. They even had to turn to the experience of their distant ancestors.\n\nOne of the worst disasters threatened to become scurvy, which occurred due to the lack of vitamin C in the body. This scourge was accompanied by damage to muscle mass, nervous disorders, rapid fatigue and infectious diseases.\n\nScurvy threatened both residents and the army, so specialists were concerned about the problem from the first days of the blockade. In the absence of sufficient medicines, they used traditional medicine recipes from the 18th century.\n\nEmployees of the Leningrad Institute of Vitamin Industry studied the archives, which described ways to combat scurvy with the help of pine needles. In the Russian Empire, it was not only effectively used at home, but also supplied to pharmacies in Western Europe.\n\nFortunately, there was an abundance of coniferous forests in the Soviet-controlled suburbs. Female rear-guard officers, who worked in two shifts, were mostly involved in the collection.\n\nConiferous legs were sorted, washed, needles were separated from the wood, washed and kneaded again. The crushed needles were treated with a solution of acetic, citric or tartaric acid (there were enough of them in the warehouses of confectionery companies), extracting vitamin C.\n\nThe greenish acidic infusion was filtered and bottled. One hundred to two hundred milliliters of this drink daily maintained the necessary level of vitamin C in the body.\n\nIn this way, the scurvy epidemic in Leningrad was prevented.\n\nIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material.",

        "content": "Great news that Speaker Johnson finally found his balls and did the right thing by putting the Ukraine support bill to the House - which duly backed it with a large majority. Notable also that included in the bill on TikTok was language that suggested that Congress supports the confiscation of the $300bn plus in immobilised Russian assets in Western jurisdiction. The House noted the fact that as Russia is the aggressor that this provides enough legal basis for confiscation. I strongly concur - let\u2019s see if the beancounters at the ECB actually manage to understand the national security imperative here.\n\nThe assumption now is the Senate votes on this this week allowing Biden to vote the Ukraine bill into law by the weekend and funds/munitions to flow by next week - long overdue - six months at least. The assumption is the U.S. has been prepositioning munitions close to theatre so that Ukrainian forces will be re-supplied in a matter of weeks now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe $61 billion was originally meant to take Ukraine thru to US elections. With the six month delay in getting this bill over the line one might think this could give Ukraine a little more time, or runway. However, given the risks still of a Trump presidency I doubt the Biden administration will risk this - disbursements on the $61 billion will surely be front loaded. That means Ukraine is going now to see a surge in military and financial support over the next six months. Doubts though still remain about long term funding beyond the U.S. election given Trump\u2019s less than certain position.\n\nAs others have argued, this funding hopefully comes just in the nick of time helping Ukraine shore up its defences which have been creaking of late as Ukraine was suffering a huge numerical disadvantage in munitions, as much as 1-10. The risk was that the Ukrainian frontline could have collapsed in places allowing Russia to take large additional swathes of Ukrainian territory. There is less chance of this now following the vote in the House. Less chance hopefully also of Ukraine being rocked by a much anticipated Russian counteroffensive north - perhaps another push to take Kyiv. Unless Putin brings forward his plans therein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine should now be able to shore up its defences and it has a chance of holding territory as is.\n\nOffensive operations likely should focus on making the continued occupation uncomfortable for Russia - rather than a large scale Ukrainian ground assault as was tried last summer. This should entail continued longer range missile strikes on Crimea, Russian naval operations in Black Sea, re-supply routes into Ukraine and attacks on infrastructure in Russia itself (oil refineries et al). The ambition here should be to make occupation so debilitating for Russia that Putin is forced to sue for peace.\n\nMuch here will depend on the munitions mix given now by the U.S. - let\u2019s hope longer range missiles are in the mix. Hopes of F16s being available at some point this year will also give Ukraine more options. And hopefully more air defences will help Ukraine protect its troops in the field and its cities and critical infrastructure - perhaps too late for much of its power generation capacity which was lost in recent weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. is sensitive about Ukrainian longer range missile attacks into Russia, particularly on energy infrastructure, given impacts on global oil prices and hence U.S. elections. These have proven highly effective in recent months and Ukraine will likely continue using arms manufactured domestically against targets in Russia. Again this has to be all about bringing the war to Russia and forcing Russia to sue for a peace acceptable to Ukraine.\n\nCrimea & the Black Sea appear to be the weak underbelly for Russia. Remember here that Putin annexed Crimea back in April 2014 for fear that post Euromaydan the peninsula would fall into NATO control - and the loss of Crimea as a strategic military asset for Ukraine. The loss of Crimea as a naval base was also seen as critical to Russian dominance in the Black Sea. And all the talk about the strategic necessity of Russia securing a land corridor to Crimea - which it took after the full scale invasion - underscores the strategic importance of Crimea to Russian military thinking. But longer range missile attacks by Ukraine have now made Crimea insecure - a huge loss to Russia compared to its position even back to before the annexation of Crimea. Having lost numerous naval assets in Crimea (likely another ship damaged over the weekend) Russia has had to deploy much of its actual Black Sea Fleet east. This represents a huge military, psychological and strategic defeat for Moscow. Further attacks on Crimea will reinforce the fact that the peninsula is no longer an asset but a huge liability to Russia - costing billions to sustain now for limited military advantage. Making Crimea and the Black Sea insecure for Russia will give Ukraine significant leverage in any future peace talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow will all this change Putin\u2019s narrative?\n\nLong wars inevitably ebb and flow. And the current Russo-Ukraine war seems no different.\n\nThis war initially saw assumptions of a speedy Russian defeat turn on Ukraine\u2019s valiant defence. We then saw successful Ukrainian counter strikes to retake territory on Kharkhiv and Kherson build optimism around a larger Ukrainian counteroffensive last summer. That failed which then saw Russia take back the initiative with gains in Bakhmut and Avdivka and elsewhere at the turn of the year.\n\nAnd much has been written in recent months of momentum in the war shifting to Russia as U.S. support withered, talk of Ukrainian military collapse and suggesting then that Russia could just wait all this out until the Trump presidency eventually threw in the towel. The line was that Ukrainian forces might collapse this year but even if they survived it was hard to see them enduring thru a Trump presidency when all U.S. support would be cut off - with Europe unable to then shoulder the additional burden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoscow seems to have believed this script - and there is much to suggest it was also not expecting the latest $61 billion to get thru Congress.\n\nHopes in Moscow of an early victory again in Ukraine have surely been dashed now, again. But the way that the House vote got over the line - Western politicians (Cameron, Duda et al) kissing the ring in Maro Lago - and then Trump\u2019s last minute suggestion that even he understood the importance of supporting Ukraine, will surely worry Moscow that Trump cannot actually be trusted to pull the plug on support for Ukraine. Moscow will now surely read the bipartisan support shown for the Ukraine bill as making it difficult to bet on a Trump presidency throwing in the towel on Ukraine. And the new $61 billion U.S. funding bill combined with Europe also appearing to finally get its act together on funding the war and its defence will surely worry Moscow that the forces being ranged now against it are appearing much more formidable.\n\nFor Moscow peace talks now might appear more logical - while it still has some advantage on the ground (if not sea), before U.S./NATO funding steps up, F16s appear, as its situation in Crimea further deteriorates and it suffers further losses in Russia itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine is still nervous over prospects of getting involved in any peace talks with Moscow as the fear is that Russia will just use any such peace to resupply for the next war. Fair points but if the West can provide enough reassurance that Ukraine\u2019s defence will remain a priority and sufficiently funded then Ukraine might just consider peace talks - the end game could be a Korean Peninsula style scenario. Many though still view the only long term solution or sustainable peace is for Russia to suffer a defeat in this war (see Timothy Synder here) - question is whether Moscow is forced to accept peace terms now whether this is a sufficient enough defeat.\n\nA question here is whether the $61 billion is a game changer in terms of Ukraine\u2019s financing outlook. It certainly helps short term - to year end 24\u2019. But again questions remain as to whether Trump will sustain US support for Ukraine. He seems to have given the nod to Johnson for the $61 billion package but given Trump\u2019s character it is hard to extrapolate that to suggest US financing is assured beyond January 2025. Given that it remains critical that the G7 signs off on the freezing and then allocation to Ukraine of the $330 billion in immobilised Russian assets in Western jurisdictions there to Ukraine. Therein the House statement was positive but still wishy washy - kind of falling back on the line that the G7 have to be in agreement for this to go ahead and deference there to the fact that most of the assets are in EU jurisdictions. Needs must though and as is, the West is still unclear how it is going to provide Ukraine\u2019s $100 billion annual financing need in war, and $50 billion plus in peace and reconstruction and recovery.\n\nReprinted from the author\u2019s @tashecon blog!

We are at a decisive moment, as all the ministers said, and I believe that the signal about the need to act faster and more effectively has really been received,\" the general said, commenting on the question about the pace of arms deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nRead also: German MoD says another Patriot system to be sent to Ukraine ASAP\n\nAccording to the general, during the meeting in Luxembourg, the ministers succeeded in providing a clear perspective on the extent to which individual member states can provide support and in what amounts.\n\nBrieger also welcomed the decision of the U.S. House of Representatives to allocate a new aid package to Ukraine.\n\n\"This means that meeting Ukraine\u2019s urgent needs is a priority for the months to come. And this will be critical, first of all, in order to prevent and stop a broad Russian offensive this summer,\" said the head of the EU Military Committee.\n\nAccording to the general, Ukraine first of all needs air defense systems and artillery ammunition. \"Also, of course, spare parts, launchers and equipment of all kinds. But the most important thing is air defense, it became clear and it will be decisive for the coming months,\" Brieger added.\n\n\"Protection of these supplies to Ukraine\" was also discussed separately.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, General Robert Brieger previously stated that Russia should not win its war of aggression against Ukraine, as it concerns the security of all of Europe.\n\nPhoto: EU Satellite Centre",

But, something went wrong...\n\nThe first collaboration between the U.S. and Soviet filmmakers was the big screen adaptation of the play \u2018The Blue Bird\u2019 by Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck. The plot is based on the story of the young children of a forester - Mytyl and Tyltyl - who go in search of the amazing Blue Bird, which brings health and happiness.\n\nIt was agreed upon to begin filming in 1974. There was a \u2018d\u00e9tente\u2019 in relations between the two countries at the time and interest in Soviet cinema in the world, thanks to Sergei Bondarchuk and his Oscar-winning film \u2018War and Peace\u2019, was at an all-time high.\n\nGeorge Cukor/Lenfilm, Twentieth Century-Fox, Edward Lewis Productions, Sovinfilm, Tower International, 1976 George Cukor/Lenfilm, Twentieth Century-Fox, Edward Lewis Productions, Sovinfilm, Tower International, 1976\n\n20th Century Fox and \u2018Lenfilm\u2019 studios worked on \u2018The Blue Bird\u2019 and filming took place entirely in the USSR. Among Hollywood stars, Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda and Ava Gardner took part in them, while among Soviet stars - Margarita Terekhova, Georgy Vitsin and the popular circus artist, Oleg Popov.\n\nThe filming process was extremely difficult. The americans didn\u2019t like the Russian food, their communication with their Soviet colleagues left much to be desired and Elizabeth Taylor often drank alcohol on set, mixing it with orange juice. In addition, the actress fell ill with dysentery and left the USSR for some time.\n\nGeorge Cukor/Lenfilm, Twentieth Century-Fox, Edward Lewis Productions, Sovinfilm, Tower International, 1976 George Cukor/Lenfilm, Twentieth Century-Fox, Edward Lewis Productions, Sovinfilm, Tower International, 1976\n\nDirector George Cukor, creator of the Oscar-winning \u2018The Philadelphia Story\u2019 and \u2018My Fair Lady\u2019, dreamed about a statuette for \u2018The Blue Bird\u2019, as well. But, his dream never came true - the movie, released in 1976, failed at the box office and is considered one of the worst adaptations of the Maeterlinck\u2019s play.\n\n\u2018The Blue Bird\u2019 was criticized for the poor performance of the actors (except for the role of the bird played by ballerina Nadezhda Pavlova) and for the weak directorial work of Kukor himself. After his failure, he made only one more movie - \u2018Rich and Famous\u2019 - which also did not live up to his previous masterpieces.\n\nIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material.",

        "content": "On Saturday April 20, the US House of Representatives passed a bill on Repurposing of Russian Sovereign Assets with the overwhelming majority of 360 against 58. It states that the President shall transfer Russian state assets in the United States to a Ukraine Support Fund. The European Union should follow this example.\n\nThis well-written bill notes that the leaders of the G7 have called Russia\u2019s \u201cunprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine\u201d a \u201cserious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum.\u201d\n\nIt cites various UN General Assembly condemnations of Russia\u2019s Aggression against Ukraine and the March 2022 International Court of Justice provisional verdict ordering Russia to \u201cimmediately suspend the military operations\u201d in Ukraine. On Nov. 14, 2022, the UN General Assembly recognized the need for the establishment of an international mechanism financially compensating Ukraine for the damage caused by Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Congress concludes that Russia \u201cbears responsibility for the financial burden of the reconstruction of Ukraine and for countless other costs associated with the illegal invasion of Ukraine.\u201d Furthermore, at least since November 2022 Russia \u201chas been on notice of its opportunity to comply with its international obligations, including to make full compensation.\u201d\n\nOther Topics of Interest Russian Offensive Begins in Kharkiv Region An unnamed senior Ukrainian military source revealed that Russian forces aim to push Ukrainian troops back up to 10 km to establish a buffer zone, but Kyiv\u2019s forces are resisting.\n\nSome $300 billion of Russian sovereign assets have been immobilized worldwide, but only $4-5 billion are supposed to be in the United States. Most Russian sovereign assets, some $190 billion, are located in Belgium. This law the United States sets an example, but it has almost no Russia assets. It calls on the president to \u201cseize, confiscate, transfer or vest any Russian aggressor sovereign assets\u201d to a \u201cUkraine Support Fund\u201d to be established, which in turn will be used for assistance to Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law calls for international action. It orders the President to act together with \u201cthe G7, the European Union, Australia and other partners\u201d to seize their Russian sovereign assets and establish an international Ukraine Compensation Fund \u201cto compensate Ukraine for damages caused by Russia\u2019s internationally wrongful acts.\u201d\n\nThe US legislation has clarified that no international law hinders the confiscation of state assets of a war criminal, such as Russia. On the contrary, war criminals have to pay war reparations, as the United Nations has repeatedly insisted. Now, it is time for the EU to act.",

        "content": "The Kremlin is conducting a concerted air and information operation to destroy Kharkiv City, convince Ukrainians to flee, and internally displace millions of Ukrainians ahead of a possible future Russian offensive operation against the city or elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said this in a new Russian offensive campaign assessment, Ukrinform reports.\n\nThe institute believes that the recent attack on a TV tower in Kharkiv is one of the moves of this information operation. In particular, analysts pointed out that Russian state media and milbloggers attempted to justify the strike by claiming that Ukrainian forces installed unspecified air defense communication and coordination equipment on the tower. They insinuated that Russian forces had tried and failed to down the Kharkiv City TV tower and other TV towers in Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts several times, including in March 2022.

        "content": "After being held up by half a year of partisan infighting in Congress, U.S. President Joe Biden signed a $61 billion package of desperately needed aid for Ukraine, showing that Kyiv\u2019s most vital ally will continue to support its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion \u2014 at least for now. But while Kyiv has welcomed the news, the six-month delay has allowed Russia to exploit Ukraine\u2019s weakened air defense system to deadly effect. Even if promised aid from the U.S. and Europe moves quickly, it will likely not reach the front lines for weeks, giving Russia a window of opportunity it could take advantage of. With the front lines barely budging over the past year, the war in the skies has started to take a greater toll, with Russia pummeling cities and infrastructure deep into Ukraine. In April, Russia destroyed the largest power plant in the Kyiv region. According to the most pessimistic estimates, Ukraine\u2019s thermal power plants have lost 85% of their generating potential due to Russian strikes in March and April. While Russia did not significantly scale up the number of weapons used in these attacks since December 2023, they were more impactful because Ukrainian forces were unable to intercept them. Analysis from the U.S. think-tank Institute for the Study of War found that Ukraine was increasingly failing to intercept even half of Russian missiles since March 22.\n\nRussian strikes now include a combined package of cruise missiles, drones and ballistic missiles to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s overstretched air defenses. While Shahed drones can be shot down by teams of mobile fire units shooting machine guns and shoulder-launched artillery from the back of pickup trucks, missiles \u2014 the fastest of which fly at 10 times the speed of sound \u2014 can only be countered with more sophisticated weaponry. Moscow has also started to employ cruise missiles equipped with technology that fires decoy flares to misdirect Ukrainian missiles that track the heat signature of their target to hit them. Another significant tactical development by Russia is its increased use of glide bombs, which has soared sixteenfold from 2023. These are converted from the plentiful Soviet-era bombs already in Russia\u2019s inventory, which once upgraded with wings and guidance systems can fly 65 kilometers after being dropped from planes behind the front line. They proved their effectiveness when Russia captured Avdiivka in the Donetsk region in February. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro said Russia dropped 700 glide bombs in the six days from March 18, days after a Russian Iskander missile destroyed two Patriot batteries.\n\nA firefighter at the Trypilska power plant near Kyiv, which was destroyed by multiple Russian missiles on April 11. State Emergency Service of Ukraine\n\nThese tactics have forced Kyiv to make difficult decisions about where to deploy its limited resources. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that as shortages have worsened, Ukraine has had to allocate a lot of its air defense assets to protect large population centers in the rear,\u201d Riley Bailey, an analyst from the Institute for the Study of War, told The Moscow Times. \u201cThat means a lot of the front line is underserved or doesn\u2019t have air defense at all. That lets Russian tactical aviation conduct glide bomb strikes that aren\u2019t accurate, but en masse cause widespread destruction to Ukrainian lines.\u201d In Russia\u2019s first response to the bill\u2019s passage through the House of Representatives, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu vowed to step up attacks on logistics centers and storage facilities for Western weapons in Ukraine. Riley said the time it takes for Ukraine's air defenses to be replenished could provide Russia with a window to intensify its attacks.\n\nIt is still unclear whether the U.S. will deliver another Patriot air defense battery to Ukraine, having only sent one so far. Germany, which has already delivered two of its 12 Patriots to Ukraine, has pledged to send another unit, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte offered to buy Patriots from countries who were hesitant to part with them. These systems are particularly crucial for Ukraine because they can fire ammunition capable of intercepting Russia\u2019s hypersonic missiles, which have been slipping through Ukraine\u2019s air defense net at particularly high rates. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kubela said that ongoing negotiations for four additional units are complicated by countries wanting \u201ccompensation\u201d for their donation. \u201cI think the U.S. army probably has one spare,\u201d he said. But these systems will be insufficient to build a defensive umbrella over all of Ukraine, the largest country fully within Europe. Analysts say Ukraine will be more able to protect its cities and soldiers if it can strike targets in Russia and the occupied territories.\n\nDestruction in Chernihiv after Russian missile attack on 17 April 2024, which killed 18 and injured more than 60 people. State Emergency Service of Ukraine\n\nWashington has long expressed reluctance to send Ukraine weaponry capable of striking targets in Russian territory for fear of escalating the war. But the week before the bill\u2019s passage, the U.S. secretly shipped long-range ATACMS with a range of up to 300 kilometers to Ukraine, who used them to strike troops in the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk on the shores of the Sea of Azov. Ukraine previously used long-range weaponry, such as Storm Shadow missiles donated by Britain, to push Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet out of Ukrainian waters and destroy submarines that launched missiles toward the country. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that his country would provide more of these weapons to Ukraine. This fear of escalating the war meant it took Washington until August 2023 to allow Kyiv\u2019s allies to donate F-16 fighter jets to provide cover for Ukrainian ground forces and bolster the country\u2019s air defense. Currently, Ukrainian pilots and ground crew are being taught in Romania how to fly and maintain the aircraft. Officials say about 12 pilots could be ready to fly F-16s in combat by July. But only six of the promised 45 jets may have been delivered by that point, less than a full squadron. While Zelensky welcomed Denmark and the Netherlands' commitment to be the first countries to donate F-16s to Ukraine as a \u201cbreakthrough agreement,\u201d other voices have been more cautious. U.S. officials privately said F-16s would not be a game changer due to Russia\u2019s own air defenses and electronic warfare that could interfere with the jets\u2019 radar.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sit in a F-16 fighter jet on August 20, 2023. Photo by Sergei GAPON / AFP\n\n\u201cIf Ukraine\u2019s F-16s can survive Russia\u2019s air defenses and has good reconnaissance, it could force Russia\u2019s planes that drop glide bombs toward Kharkiv and Ukrainian soldiers further back from the front line, where the effective range of those weapons will be reduced,\u201d Retired Air Marshal Edward Stringer, who served as director general of Britain\u2019s Joint Force Development, Strategic Command, told The Moscow Times. Stringer also said that although donating F-16s was the right decision, they may be less effective over Ukraine than in other NATO missions, where they are deployed as part of a package with other NATO jets to support them. Even if these obstacles can be overcome, Ukraine would still be reliant on the U.S. and Europe to produce and supply expensive air-to-air missiles.\n\nDestruction in Kharkiv after Russian missile strike. State Emergency Service of Ukraine\n\nKharkiv lies just 30 kilometers from Ukraine\u2019s border with Russia, leaving it particularly exposed to missile and drone attacks. Sirens have become an inescapable part of life for the city\u2019s 1.3 million residents \u2014 roughly half of its pre-war population \u2014 who have opened schools and even a ballet theater underground. Residents only have electricity for a few hours each day after Russia destroyed the three power stations that supply the city. Russia has started to time its attacks to coincide with these power outages, forcing residents to wait in agony for cellphone signal to resume so they can reach their loved ones. Ukrainian officials have voiced concerns that Russia is intensifying its bombardment of Kharkiv, as well as spreading propaganda, to make the city unlivable. Russian officials have signaled their intention to create a buffer zone along Ukraine's northern border. Ada Wordsworth, head of the KHARPP NGO which supports Kharkiv region villages, told The Moscow Times that people felt a huge sense of relief at the news that more U.S. support was on the way. \u201cHowever, this relief comes with a fair amount of resentment because of how long it has taken, and how many lives \u2014 civilian and military \u2014 have been lost,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's also a limited hope for the impact this funding will have in terms of protecting the sky over cities like Kharkiv, which are so close to the Russian border, unless Ukraine is allowed to use these weapons to strike Russian territory,\u201d something Washington has said it does not support.",

The US agreed to send 31 Abrams to Ukraine in January 2023. Five have been lost to Russian attacks. The proliferation of drones means \u201cthere isn\u2019t open ground that you can just drive across without fear of detection\u201d, a senior defence official said on Thursday. \u201cNow, there is a way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with our Ukrainian partners, and other partners on the ground, to help them think through how they might use that, in that kind of changed environment now, where everything is seen immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians have not adopted tactics that could have made the tanks more effective, one of the US defence officials said, such as in combined-arms warfare, training for which was provided by the US in Germany. Russian forces have sustained heavy losses of their own tanks and armoured equipment due to highly effective surveillance and attacks by Ukrainian drone warfare units.\n\nThe US does not expect Ukraine to launch large-scale offensive operations against Russian forces in the near term, a US defence official said. The goal was to help Ukraine\u2019s forces \u201cregain the initiative \u2026 In terms of what we see in the next several months of operations, Ukrainians will need to rebuild quite a bit to take on board all of these new supplies after having rationed ammunition and other supplies \u2026 and ensure that they can defend their positions\u201d.\n\nIntense artillery, rocket and drone attacks either side of the Russia-Ukraine frontline left at least 10 people dead and more than a dozen wounded, regional officials said. Russian attacks killed at least six in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian officials said. Four people were killed in Russian-occupied parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, according to Moscow-installed authorities.\n\nChina must stop supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine if it wants to enjoy good relations with the west, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in Berlin on Thursday. \u201cLast year, Russia imported 90% of its microelectronics from China, used to produce missiles, tanks and aircraft. China is also working to provide Russia with improved satellite capabilities and imaging,\u201d he said. \u201cChina says it wants good relations with the west \u2026 They cannot have it both ways.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg cautioned western allies: \u201cIn the past, we made the mistake of becoming dependent on Russian oil and gas. We must not repeat that mistake with China. Depending on its money, its raw materials, its technologies \u2013 dependencies make us vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Macron has warned that Europe faces an existential threat from Russian aggression and must adopt a \u201ccredible\u201d defence strategy less dependent on the US.

In his almost two-hour-long speech, Macron warned that \u201cour Europe, today, is mortal and it can die\u201d, Jennifer Rankin writes from Brussels.\n\nPoland and Lithuania have said they are prepared to help Ukrainian authorities return men subject to military conscription, after Ukraine\u2019s government announced this week that it was suspending consular services and the issue of passports for such men who are living abroad, Shaun Walker writes from Warsaw. \u201cWe have suggested for a long time that we can help the Ukrainian side ensure that people subject to [compulsory] military service go to Ukraine,\u201d W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland\u2019s defence minister, told the television channel Polsat. His Lithuanian counterpart, Laurynas Kas\u010di\u016bnas, said his country may make similar efforts. \u201cUkraine is very short of mobilisation reserve \u2026 This is not fair to those citizens who are fighting for their country.\u201d\n\nThe Polish parliament is due to consider new regulations next week that would require all Ukrainians to show a valid passport to be able to access benefits in Poland. Previously, Ukrainian refugees had been able to do so by showing any other documents proving their identity. Kosiniak-Kamysz, the defence minister, said: \u201cI think many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine.\u201d Tadeusz Ko\u0142odziej, a Polish NGO lawyer, said: \u201cThe draft text we have seen would cut around 80% of benefits for people without passports \u2026 If it will be impossible to get a passport, many of these people may ask for asylum.\u201d",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe $95 billion military aid package President Joe Biden signed Wednesday was a feat of tough-minded negotiation to get funding to Ukraine and Israel after months of congressional horse-trading. But if the aid inflates those countries\u2019 war aims, it could discourage the kind of tough-minded negotiation that is the only way to end their wars.\n\nMark Hannah Courtesy of Mark Hannah\n\nBiden is right to help democratic countries confront their illiberal enemies. Israel and Ukraine suffered terrible crimes of aggression. But lofty expressions of unconditional support can paradoxically hurt the countries they are meant to help by hindering the kind of negotiated peace that saves civilian lives and restores stability.\n\nThe funds might motivate Ukraine and Israel to pursue unwinnable victories: the full restoration of Ukraine\u2019s borders and reclamation of Crimea, and the destruction of Hamas, respectively. In international politics and armed conflict, fraught as they are with mutual distrust and competing views of fairness, sometimes countries can\u2019t achieve justice \u2014 they can only achieve peace.\n\nThe new infusion of aid gives the US a lot of leverage with Ukraine and Israel. Washington has largely refused to exercise its leverage thus far, but it must do so now or peace in the near future doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to maintain that \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas is the only outcome he will accept. But as the war grinds on, Israel reports having killed fewer than half of Hamas\u2019 fighters while its tunnel network hasn\u2019t been completely dismantled, indicating the group can likely sustain an insurgency against Israel for the foreseeable future. And even if it were possible to destroy Hamas, that outcome could prove to be a catastrophic success when images of the accompanying civilian devastation fuel ever more radicalization among Palestinians and stirs angry Arab publics who pressure their leaders to scuttle Arab-Israeli normalization efforts.\n\nSimilarly, the Ukrainian government insists it will continue fighting until it regains all of the territory it has lost, including Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and there is no sign the US administration is pushing it to reconsider. But as Gen. Mark Milley, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me a year ago, \u201cneither side is likely to achieve their complete political objectives through military means\u201d so \u201cit will probably end somewhere, somehow at a negotiating table.\u201d And that was before Ukraine lost some of its best troops and equipment in last summer\u2019s highly anticipated offensive, which failed to strike a knockout blow to Russia.\n\nTo its credit, the administration seems clear-eyed enough to privately acknowledge Ukraine\u2019s chances for retaking additional territory are slim. But there is still no public indication the US is trying to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement. Signaling American resolve can preserve Ukraine\u2019s bargaining position, but it risks convincing Ukraine to reject a reasonable peace deal \u2014 if one is eventually offered \u2014 and continue fighting in pursuit of morally righteous but unattainable goals.\n\nLikewise, while the administration has ramped up humanitarian aid to Gaza, encouraged negotiations to get Hamas to release Israeli hostages and called for the Palestinian Authority to administer Gaza, it could do more to convince Israel to fundamentally rethink its destabilizing goals. The Biden administration should publicly and privately convey to Israel\u2019s leaders that their current strategy is unlikely to succeed and undermines regional security.\n\nThere will be at least a few objections to orienting American policy toward the best possible outcomes in these conflicts \u2014 achieving peace and stability in the near term \u2014 rather than the unrealistic goals of our partners.\n\nWar has a way of eliciting worldviews organized around simplistic binaries. After the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, then-President George W. Bush declared that every country had to decide: \u201cEither you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\u201d When Biden spoke of the war in Ukraine, Americans were told we faced a choice between offering Kyiv unconditional support or \u201cwithdrawing\u201d from the conflict and letting Putin \u201cerase\u201d Ukraine. But these kinds of Manichean views that divide the world into evil aggressors and righteous victims do not make impossible military victories any more achievable.\n\nSome people will say that the US can\u2019t simply tell Ukraine and Israel, both sovereign countries, what to do. Indeed, this has largely been Biden\u2019s public position, evident in his mantra \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and in the State Department\u2019s insistence that \u201cthe United States doesn\u2019t dictate to Israel what it must do.\u201d\n\nThese countries do have agency \u2014 but so does the United States. American involvement in assisting these nations\u2019 war efforts gives it the right and responsibility to share the course of each conflict in ways that protect its interests. The US can respect Ukraine\u2019s and Israel\u2019s agency without subjugating its own.\n\nIn Ukraine, this doesn\u2019t mean threatening the withdrawal of aid, which would weaken its battlefield and negotiating position. Instead, the US could have enforced the restrictions it had already made (on Abrams Tanks, F-16s, cluster munitions and long-range missiles) or it could now materially support diplomatic efforts as enthusiastically as military efforts. However, the recent aid package includes long-range missiles, or ATACMS, which suggests Ukraine is readying an offensive against Crimea. For a year and a half, Biden judiciously refused to send these to Ukraine, calling them a \u201cred line\u201d for Putin, who might use nuclear weapons were Crimea attacked.\n\nIn Israel, putting conditions on military aid is a better idea. The US did use leverage after an Israeli military strike killed aid workers from World Central Kitchen \u2014 with sources telling CNN that Biden warned Netanyahu that the US would reconsider how it\u2019s supporting Israel\u2019s war unless Israel allowed for more humanitarian aid in Gaza. After that, Israel acceded to the ultimatum and, per a reported demand by Biden, publicly announced the change that day. Unfortunately, there\u2019s little evidence the president has kept up the pressure. When the aid package passed Congress, a pro-Israel lobbying group cheered that the security assistance came \u201cwith no added conditions.\u201d\n\nOne historical example illustrates how the US might use its leverage with Netanyahu today. After Israel encircled the Egyptian military in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to Tel Aviv and pressured Prime Minister Golda Meir to enact a ceasefire. Egypt\u2019s attack was, like that of Hamas, an unprovoked and surprise act of aggression. Kissinger feared a victory by the Soviet-backed Arab states. But recently declassified documents show he also feared an all-out Israeli victory.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nKissinger wrote that \u201cfrom an Israeli point of view, it is no disaster to have the whole Arab world radicalized and anti-American, because this guarantees our continued support. From an American point of view, it is a disaster.\u201d Kissinger advised that the US needed \u201cto be taken even more seriously\u201d by Israel, and \u201cour insistence on a more politically oriented policy cannot go unheeded.\u201d This advice rings even truer today.\n\nFundamentally, negotiated settlements are often morally unsatisfying. Russia shouldn\u2019t be allowed to invade a sovereign country and get away with it. Israel has the right to defend itself. But too narrow a focus on what\u2019s morally just obscures an appreciation for what\u2019s strategically possible. What\u2019s possible, in both Ukraine and Gaza, is peace.",

Some 193 states have ratified the convention.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.\n\nChloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to \"dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions\" - is an oily substance which was widely used during World War One. It causes irritation of the lungs, eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC).\n\nThe chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW.\n\nThe state department also said Moscow had regularly used \"riot control agents,\" or tear gas, during the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has previously warned Russia against deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine. In March 2022, weeks after Moscow launched its invasion, Mr Biden vowed that President Vladimir Putin would pay a \"severe price\" if he did authorise the use of chemical weapons.\n\n\"We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nBut there have been consistent reports that Moscow has ignored that warning. US Assistant Secretary for Arms Control Mallory Stewart has previously said Russia was using riot control agents in the conflict.\n\nAnd Ukraine says its troops have faced mounting chemical attacks in recent months. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this year that Russian forces had used grenades loaded with CS and CN tear gases.\n\nThe report added that at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic gases, and that one had died after suffocating on tear gas.\n\nThree Russian bodies linked to the country's biological and chemical weapons programme were sanctioned by the state department for their links to the production of chemical agents. Other firms that contributed to the government entities were also sanctioned.",

        "content": "Serbian lawmakers on Thursday voted into office a new government that reinstated two pro-Russia officials who are sanctioned by the United States, reflecting persistent close ties with Moscow despite the Balkan nation's proclaimed bid to join the European Union.\n\nPrime Minister Milo\u0161 Vu\u010devi\u0107's government got backing in a 152-61 vote in the 250-member parliament. The remaining 37 lawmakers were absent.\n\nUS-SANCTIONED EX-INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WITH RUSSIAN TIES TO BE APPOINTED SERBIAN VICE-PREMIER\n\nThe government includes former intelligence chief Aleksandar Vulin, who has made several visits to Russia in recent months, as one of several vice-premiers, along with Nenad Popovi\u0107, another Russia supporter who has faced U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe foreign minister in the previous government, Ivica Da\u010di\u0107, also a pro-Russia politician, will be in charge of the Interior Ministry in the new Cabinet.\n\nThe vote followed a heated two-day debate. President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107's ruling nationalist conservative Serbian Progressive Party holds a comfortable majority after an election in December that fueled political tensions because of reports of widespread irregularities.\n\nThe increasingly authoritarian Vu\u010di\u0107 has refused to join Western sanctions against Moscow over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, though Serbia has condemned the aggression.\n\nVu\u010devi\u0107, the new prime minister, reiterated that Belgrade doesn't intend to impose sanctions on Russia and \"cannot and will not give up\" its friendship with Russia. Integration into the EU remains a \"strategic goal.\"\n\nHe added that the \"best possible\" ties with the U.S. are also in Serbia's interest.\n\n\"I firmly believe that our relations can once again be on a high level,\" Vu\u010devi\u0107 said.\n\nFilip Ejdus, a security analyst and a Belgrade university professor, described the new government's composition as \"spin\" designed for the West and Russia, and for voters at home.\n\n\"It sends a message to the EU that they should not push Belgrade too much over democracy, rule of law, or Kosovo if they want to keep Serbia in its orbit,\" Ejdus said. \"At the same time, it signals to Moscow a readiness to strengthen the strategic partnership with Russia.\"\n\nThe U.S. imposed sanctions on Vulin in July, accusing him of involvement in illegal arms shipments, drug trafficking and misuse of public office.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control said that Vulin used his public authority to help a U.S.-sanctioned Serbian arms dealer move illegal arms shipments across Serbia\u2019s borders. Vulin is also accused of involvement in a drug trafficking ring, according to U.S. authorities.\n\nVulin, who in the past had served as both the army and police chief, has recently received two medals of honor from Russia, one from the Federal Security Service, or FSB, and the other was awarded to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPopovi\u0107, a businessman and a former government minister, has \"used his Russia-based businesses to enrich himself and gain close connections with Kremlin senior leaders,\" the U.S. Treasury said last November in a statement.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Radomir Lazovic criticized the inclusion of the disputed ministers. Lazovic said \"these individuals shouldn\u2019t be part of the government, not just because they are blacklisted, but because their harmful behavior has hurt the citizens of Serbia.\"\n\nThe U.S. sanctions against individuals and companies in the Balkans are designed to counter attempts to undermine peace and stability in the volatile region and Russia's \"malign\" influence.\n\nThe West has stepped up efforts to lure the troubled region into its fold, fearing that Russia could stir unrest to avert attention from the war in Ukraine. The Balkans went through multiple wars in the 1990s, and tensions still persist.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSerbia's falling democracy record has pushed the country away from EU integration, explained Ejdus. Reports of election fraud at the Dec. 17 vote triggered street protests and clashes.\n\n\"Vu\u010di\u0107 is still pretending to be on the EU path because it\u2019s beneficial for Serbia\u2019s economy, and the EU tolerates his authoritarian tendencies out of fear of instability that could be caused in its backyard if Belgrade was lost to Russia and China,\" Ejdus said.",

        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron will next week make a new push to try and dissuade China's Xi Jinping from supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine but is unlikely to make a breakthrough on ending the conflict during the visit, observers say.\n\nPresident Xi's visit is set to be rich on symbolism \u2013 with a sumptuous dinner at the Elysee Palace and a trip to the Pyrenees mountains planned \u2013 but risks being short on diplomatic success for the French leader.\n\n\u201cFrance and the European Union expect him to use his influence on Russia, but Xi Jinping has nothing to offer on Ukraine,\u201d said a former European diplomat, asking not to be named.\n\nXi is due to make a state visit to France on Monday and Tuesday, followed by visits to Serbia and Hungary, two European countries retaining warm ties with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Xi and Macron will discuss international crises, trade, climate change and cultural exchanges, the key aim will be to \u201cpoint out that for Europe, the first issue with China is its position on Ukraine,\u201d said a source close to the French government.\n\nOn a visit to China in 2023, Macron had already called on Xi to \u201cbring Russia to its senses\u201d over Ukraine and urged him not to deliver weapons to Moscow.\n\n\u2018Done nothing on Ukraine\u2019\n\nLittle has changed, however. Xi will host Putin for talks in China later this month.\n\nMacron, 46, indicated he had not given up on the idea of trying to get Xi, 70, on his side.\n\nOther Topics of Interest China's Xi in Hungary to Celebrate 'New Era' With Orban Earlier this week, the Chinese leader kicked off his trip in France, a visit that was cordial but also highlighted tensions between Beijing and the EU over the war in Ukraine and global trade.\n\n\u201cIt's not in China's interest today to have a Russia that destabilizes the international order,\u201d the French president said in an interview with The Economist published on Thursday. \u201cWe need to work with China to build peace.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has urged Beijing to play a greater role in ending the Ukraine war, will join Macron and Xi for talks on Monday.\n\nMacron has said he will ask the Chinese president to help him achieve that aim when he visits Paris, which is preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a historic tradition that peace should reign during the Olympics \u2013 although the opening of the Games in Beijing in August 2008 did not halt Russia's invasion of Georgia.\n\n\u201cOn Ukraine, China has done nothing,\u201d said Marc Julienne, director of the Centre for Asian Studies at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).\n\nIn February 2023, China published a 12-point position paper on Ukraine, but it was rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.\n\n\u2018Counter the West'\n\nBeijing, which says it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict, has been criticized for refusing to condemn Moscow for its offensive.\n\nThe United States had accused China of helping Russia carry out its biggest militarization since Soviet times.\n\nUS officials say China has provided dual-use supplies that have let Russia regroup in the face of a long delay in US aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn April, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this included \u201cmachine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defense industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina has rejected the US claims as \u201cgroundless accusations.\u201d\n\nMacron, too, is expected to raise \u201cconcerns\u201d about \u201cthe activity of certain Wuhan companies that could be directly involved in or contribute significantly to the Russian war effort,\u201d according to a member of his team.\n\nBeijing is a major supporter of the Russian economy.\n\nChina-Russia trade in 2023 reached a record $240 billion, according to customs data, overshooting a goal of $200 billion set by the neighbors.\n\nExperts say Beijing is unlikely to renounce support for Moscow, which it sees as a priority partner in its opposition to the United States.\n\n\u201cXi Jinping's priority is the Global South,\u201d said Emmanuel Lincot, a China expert at the Catholic University of Paris.\n\n\u201cThere is a congruence in the Sino-Russian bilateral relationship, particularly in the desire to counter the West. Which is not to say that there is no rivalry.\u201d",

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2013 Germany on Friday accused Russian military agents of hacking the top echelons of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s party and other sensitive government and industrial targets, and was joined by NATO and fellow European countries in warning that Russia\u2019s cyberespionage would have consequences.\n\nRelations between Russia and Germany were already tense, with Germany providing military support to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Russian military cyber operators were behind the hacking of emails of the Social Democrats, the leading party in the governing coalition. Officials said they did so by exploiting Microsoft Outlook.\n\nOfficials described a hacking campaign that persisted for months.\n\nThe German Interior Ministry said in a statement that the hacking campaign began at least as early as March 2022 \u2013 a month after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2013 with emails at Social Democrat party headquarters accessed beginning that December. It said German companies, including in the defense and aerospace sectors, as well as targets related to the war were also a focus.\n\nThe statement said international efforts led by the FBI shut down in late January a botnet of compromised network devices used by the Russian hackers \u2013 known as APT28 or Fancy Bear \u2013 in the cyberespionage scheme.\n\n\u201cRussian state hackers attacked Germany in cyberspace,\u201d Baerbock said at a news conference in the Australian city of Adelaide. She attributed the hack to a unit of Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence unit.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely intolerable and unacceptable and will have consequences,\u201d she said, without specifying what they might be.\n\nA separate German statement said the hacking occurred over \u201ca relatively long period\u201d and also targeted various unidentified German government authorities, foundations and associations. It said the Social Democrats\u2019 executive committee was targeted.\n\nThe Council of the EU and the Czech Foreign Ministry said Czechia\u2019s institutions have also been targeted by the same group. Both German and Czech officials said the GRU hackers leveraged a previously unknown vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook.\n\nIn a statement by the EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, the bloc\u00b4s nations said they \u201cstrongly condemn the malicious cyber campaign\u201d by Fancy Bear \u201cagainst Germany and Czechia.\u201d\n\nThe EU noted that it had previously imposed sanctions on individuals and entities associated with the group for targeting the German parliament in 2015. It said it will not tolerate the continuation of such attacks, particularly with EU elections upcoming in June.\n\nNATO accused Fancy Bear of targeting \u201cother national governmental entities, critical infrastructure operators and other entities across the Alliance,\u201d including in Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to employ the necessary capabilities in order to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of cyberthreats to support each other, including by considering coordinated responses,\u201d said the North Atlantic Council, the principal political decision-making body within NATO.\n\nBaerbock is visiting Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, with the trip focusing on security policy as China pushes for influence in the Pacific region.\n\n\u201cThe defense cooperation between Germany and Australia is close and we would like to deepen it further and together expand it, because we are in a situation where we face similar threats,\u201d said Baerbock, who is the first German foreign minister to visit Australia in 13 years.\n\nDiscussions between Baerbock and Australia counterpart Penny Wong centered on the conflict in Gaza. \u201cI think we all understand that the only path out of this cycle of violence that we see in the Middle East at such great cost is one that ultimately ensures a two-state solution,\u201d Wong said.\n\nSix in Ten Germans Unwilling to Pick Up Arms to Defend the Country if Attacked https://t.co/Jxv9ix8eUh \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 9, 2024",

        "content": "Senior Italian government officials admonished French President Emmanuel Macron over his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdesperate\u201d rhetoric on the war in Ukraine such as suggesting sending NATO troops into the war.\n\nPresident Macron, initially one of the leading advocates for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow, has increasingly become one of the most hawkish voices in the European Union. Over the past week alone, the French leader has suggested arming the EU with nuclear weapons in light of the supposed threat from Russia and doubled down on his suggestion of sending NATO troops into the war if Russia breaks through Ukraine\u2019s front line and Kyiv requests the aid of foreign soldiers.\n\nMacron\u2019s comments have drawn criticism from fellow NATO ally and EU member state Italy, which has flatly ruled out sending Italian troops into the conflict.\n\nThe harshest rebuke came from Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the populist League party, Matteo Salvini, who wrote on social media: \u201cSending Italian soldiers to fight outside the EU borders? Follow the obsessions of some dangerous and desperate European leader like Macron? No thanks, never in the name of the League.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper, Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said: \u201cI don\u2019t judge a president of a friendly country like France, but I don\u2019t understand the purpose and usefulness of these declarations, which objectively raise tensions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur position does not change: we have always said that Ukraine needed to be helped in every possible way, and we are doing so, but we have also always excluded direct intervention by our military in the conflict,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to provide aid, as we have done so far, for as long as it is useful and as long as we are able to do so.\u201d\n\nMacron Suggests Arming EU with Nuclear Weapons for \u2018Credible\u2019 Defencehttps://t.co/0XT5NvIJuW \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 28, 2024\n\nIn an interview over the weekend with La Tribune, Macron defended his recent rhetoric as an attempt at \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d.\n\nRussia decided unilaterally in February 2022 to attack a sovereign state, Ukraine, and therefore not to respect international law, the Charter of the United Nations\u2026 It has decided to resolutely become a destabilising power which gives no strategic limits to its action. And President Putin has constantly brandished the nuclear threat.\n\n\u201cFaced with such an adversary, what weakness to draw a priori limits, what weakness! On the contrary, we must remove all visibility from it, because that is what creates the capacity to deter.\n\n\u201cThe security of Europeans is at stake in Ukraine because it is 1,500 kilometres from our borders. If Russia wins, the next second, there is no longer any security possible in Romania, in Poland, in Lithuania and not in our country either. The capability and range of Russian ballistic missiles exposes us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussian excitement shows that we are right not to close any doors. Otherwise, it means that we agree to renounce an international order based on law and therefore peace and security,\u201d he concluded.\n\nMacron is not alone in ratcheting up the stakes in Ukraine, with UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron saying that Kyiv has the right to use British-supplied missiles and other weapons within the Russian mainland.\n\n\u201cUkraine has that right. Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it\u2019s defending itself,\u201d the former British prime minister told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nCameron, speaking from Ukraine, also said that the UK would supply Ukraine with three billion pounds ($3.74 billion) in military aid every year for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d.\n\nWWIII Watch: Macron Floats Troops in Ukraine for First Time, Moscow Warns of \u2018Inevitable\u2019 War with NATOhttps://t.co/NjQbqHsN1Q \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 27, 2024",

The trip is his first to Europe since 2019 and will also see him visit Serbia and Hungary later in the week.\n\nBut Xi's choice of France as the sole major European power on his itinerary indicates the importance the leader of the one-party Communist state of more than 1.4 billion people accords to Macron as an EU powerbroker over two years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nXi and Macron are to hold a day of talks in Paris on Monday from 0830 GMT -- also including EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen for a morning trilateral meeting -- followed by a state banquet hosted by Macron at the Elysee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuesday will see Macron take Xi, who is accompanied by his wife Peng Liyuan, to the Pyrenees mountains to an area he used to visit as a boy for a day of less public and more intimate talks.\n\nIn an op-ed for Le Figaro daily, Xi said that he wanted to work with the international community to find ways to solve the conflict sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while emphasising that China was \"neither a party nor a participant\" in the conflict.\n\n\"We hope that peace and stability will return quickly to Europe, and intend to work with France and the entire international community to find good paths to resolve the crisis,\" he wrote.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Russian Offensive Begins in Kharkiv Region An unnamed senior Ukrainian military source revealed that Russian forces aim to push Ukrainian troops back up to 10 km to establish a buffer zone, but Kyiv\u2019s forces are resisting.\n\n- 'Stability of international order' -\n\nA key priority of Macron will be to warn Xi of the danger of backing Russia, with Western officials concerned Moscow is already using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nBeijing's ties with Moscow have, if anything, warmed after the invasion and the West wants China above all not to supply weapons to Russia and risk tipping the balance in the conflict.\n\n\"It is in our interest to get China to weigh in on the stability of the international order,\" Macron said in an interview with the Economist published on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacron also said in the same interview that Europe must defend its \"strategic interests\" in its economic relations with China, accusing Beijing of not respecting the rules on international trade.\n\nBut he acknowledged in an interview with the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper that Europeans are \"not unanimous\" on the strategy to adopt as \"certain actors still see China essentially as a market of opportunities\" while it \"exports massively\" to Europe.\n\nThe French president had gladdened Chinese state media and troubled some EU allies after his 2023 visit by declaring that Europe should not be drawn into a \"bloc versus bloc\" standoff between China and the United States, particularly over democratic, self-ruled Taiwan.\n\nChina views the island as part of its territory and has vowed to take it one day, by force if necessary.\n\n- 'Two core messages' -\n\nRights groups are urging Macron to bring up human rights in the talks, accusing China of failing to respect the rights of the Uyghur Muslim minority and of keeping dozens of journalists behind bars.\n\n\"President Macron should make it clear to Xi Jinping that Beijing's crimes against humanity come with consequences for China's relations with France,\" said Maya Wang, acting China director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group said human rights in China had \"severely deteriorated\" under Xi's rule.\n\nHundreds of protesters Sunday unfurled a Tibetan flag at a demonstration in Paris, accusing Xi of being a \"dictator\" and wanting to erase local culture in the Tibet region, an AFP reporter said.\n\nHowever analysts are sceptical that Macron will be able to exercise much sway over the Chinese leader, even with the lavish red-carpet welcome and a trip to the bracing mountain air of the Col du Tourmalet over 2,000 metres (6,560 feet) above sea level on Tuesday.\n\nThe other two countries chosen by Xi for his tour, Serbia and Hungary, are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\n\"The two core messages from Macron will be on Chinese support to Russia's military capabilities and Chinese market-distorting practices,\" said Janka Oertel, director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\"However, both messages are unlikely to have a significant impact on Chinese behaviour: Xi is not on a mission to repair ties, because from his point of view all is well.\"",

        "content": "With preparation for a Ukraine Peace Summit in June underway, concerns remain that the talks may lack strong participation from the Global South and from China in particular.\n\nNext month, Switzerland will host a high-level international summit aimed at outlining a roadmap for future peace efforts in Ukraine, with 160 national delegations expected to be invited to the talks.\n\nThe Lucerne summit could gain diplomatic weight as G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden, could jointly stop in Switzerland after their grouping\u2019s gathering in Italy.\n\nWhile Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s 10-point peace formula is expected to be the basis for the talks, the several other peace plans for Ukraine known so far are expected to play a role.\n\nUkraine\u2019s blueprint envisages Russia withdrawing all of its troops from the country\u2019s territory, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, release of all prisoners of war and deportees, preventing ecocide in Ukraine, and punishing those responsible for war crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia since then has repeated its minimum demands, which include demilitarisation and neutral status for Ukraine as well as the ceding of territory to Russia. For Kyiv, these conditions would amount to surrender.\n\nSpeaking about the goals of the summit, Zelenskyy said \u201cRussia can only be forced to leave Ukraine alone\u201d and will not leave by itself.\n\n\u201cPutin does not want peace, he is insane, and every day his state does new things to prove it. And to overcome this evil, to overcome the war, we need the maximum unity of the world,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Scholz Urges More Ukrainian Refugees in Germany to Take Up Work Germany is the EU country that has taken in the most Ukrainian refugees, about a third of the total. However, only about 18% were employed in January 2024, one of the lowest rates in the OECD.\n\nRussia will not be invited \u201cat this stage\u201d of the talks, the Swiss government said, though stressed that Moscow should be involved in the process \u201csooner or later.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials say Russians would only be allowed to take part in a follow-up summit, but according to Kyiv only to accept the Ukrainian conditions.\n\nFor Kyiv, direct peace negotiations would be another weapon of war, used to distract Western attention while pushing further on the battlefield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToo big are the fears of a repeat of the Minsk agreements, negotiated under the auspices of France, Germany, and the OSCE to end the conflict in the Donbas region, which have long since become a byword for the West\u2019s failure to deal with the post-2014 conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBut Russia currently sees itself as being on the winning track militarily. With Moscow\u2019s troops scoring small advances around the frontline in recent weeks, it doesn\u2019t believe it has to negotiate.\n\nFor Sergey Radchenko, professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), a solution remains far off, despite the efforts: \u201cThe Russians are clearly still hoping to win this war outright, while Ukraine is hoping that they will rally Western support and outlast Russia in the long-term.\u201d\n\nHe is also sceptical of a summit going ahead without Russia.\n\n\u201cAn eventual ceasefire agreement/peace treaty would have to involve Russia: there is no way around it because a negotiation that does not involve a key party is more of a solidarity exercise than a true negotiation,\u201d Radchenko told Euractiv.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the June talks, Ukraine and its Western allies want to rally broader international support for Kyiv, campaigning to persuade as many non-Western countries as possible to attend.\n\nDiplomats involved in the preparations say there are fears the summit threatens to become a Western affair, without strong Global South participation.\n\nWhile previous rounds of preparatory meetings managed to attract more non-Western states, it might be more difficult to secure the same when it comes to higher-level participation from those countries, they worry.\n\nChina, which experts say is unlikely to renounce support for Russia, has warned it won\u2019t participate if Russia isn\u2019t represented.\n\nFurther conditions for China to participate include confirmation that it will not amount to a full-blown summit so that they could send an envoy instead of a high-ranking politician, as well as their and other peace blueprints to be considered, people with knowledge of the discussion said.\n\n\u201cI do not think that the purpose \u2013 rallying the Global South and/or China \u2013 will be served particularly well by [not inviting Russia], as we already have witnessed from earlier gatherings, like in Malta,\u201d Radchenko said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the perspective of Western diplomats, it is clear that if Beijing, Moscow\u2019s most important ally, does not take part, the summit can hardly be a success.\n\nThat being said, EU officials are increasingly sceptical about the role Beijing can play in any future peace process.\n\nWith Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s trip to Europe, they hope Beijing\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine will be a key topic and Europeans will be able to convince Beijing it is in its interest to play a greater role in ending the Ukraine war.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said he will ask Xi to commit to that goal when he visits Paris, which is preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer.\n\nIt is customary where peace is expected to be upheld during the Olympics, but the 2008 Games in Beijing did not halt Russia\u2019s August invasion of Georgia back then.\n\nAt the same time, Western officials fear the next few weeks might be marked by Russia making more tactical gains in eastern Ukraine, especially around the key June date.\n\nA changed reality on the ground could change the dynamics of the talks, with increased pressure about the need to kickstart actual peace talks, they worry.\n\n\u201cA conference that actually aims to achieve a breakthrough would have to entail a protracted negotiation between a very limited number of parties,\u201d Radchenko said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment what we are seeing is a tendency towards a short PR event with a large number of parties, except the ones that matter,\u201d he added.",

They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\u201d Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine\u2019s eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \u201cgoing to take a while\u201d and warned of the \u201cincreasing\u201d threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world\u2019s two largest nuclear arsenals.

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian forces to rehearse deploying tactical nuclear weapons, as part of military drills to respond to what he called \u201cthreats\u201d by the West.\n\nSince invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly made veiled threats to use tactical nuclear weapons against the West, but Monday marked the first time Russia has publicly announced drills.\n\n\u201cDuring the exercises, a set of measures will be carried out to practice the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\u201d Russia\u2019s defense ministry said.\n\nNon-strategic, or \u201ctactical,\u201d nuclear weapons can be used in battlefield situations, carrying less power than strategic nuclear weapons, which have the potential to level entire cities.\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said the drills were ordered after \u201cprovocative statements and threats\u201d by Western officials against Russia, which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said had reached \u201cunprecedented levels.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron last week reaffirmed that he would not rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine, as he warned of the risks Russia poses to European security and other countries near its borders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything out, because we are facing someone who is not ruling anything out,\u201d Macron told The Economist magazine. \u201cI have a clear strategic objective: Russia cannot win in Ukraine. If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said he cannot rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine. Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnd during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\u201d Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine\u2019s eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \u201cgoing to take a while\u201d and warned of the \u201cincreasing\u201d threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world\u2019s two largest nuclear arsenals. Putin said Russia would not be the first to test nuclear weapons, but would do so in the event of a US test.\n\nAfter Macron said in February that sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, Putin warned \u201cthis really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization.\u201d\n\nUS President Joe Biden and State Department officials have previously downplayed concerns that Putin could deploy a nuclear weapon, but continue to take the threats seriously.\n\nIn response to Russia\u2019s latest announcement, the US said it had seen no change in Russia\u2019s \u201cstrategic force posture\u201d following Moscow\u2019s announcement that it would begin tactical nuclear weapons drills, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder.\n\nRyder said Russia\u2019s announcement is \u201ccompletely inappropriate,\u201d and \u201can example of the kind of irresponsible rhetoric that we\u2019ve seen from Russia in the past.\u201d\n\nIn late 2022, the US began \u201cpreparing rigorously\u201d for Russia potentially striking Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon, in what would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly 80 years before, two senior administration officials previously told CNN.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s announcement, Russia\u2019s defense ministry said the military\u2019s General Staff had begun preparations for conducting \u201cexercises in the near future with missile formations of the Southern Military District involving aviation as well as naval forces.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Defense Ministry of Belarus said on Telegram it had held a \u201csurprise inspection\u201d of non-strategic nuclear arms carriers. President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the inspection to \u201ctest the entire range of activities from planning, preparation, and use of strikes with tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d according to Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin.\n\nKhrenin also said that \u201ca division of the Iskander operational-tactical complex and a squadron of Su-25 aircraft\u201d have been transferred into positions for the drills.\n\nBelarus does not possess its own nuclear weapons. Russia and Belarus signed an agreement to place Moscow\u2019s non-strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus in May of 2023 and the transfer was completed by October of that year. Lukashenko has previously said that the nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus are for \u201cdefensive purposes\u201d only and could be used to \u201crespond to aggression.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand and Mariya Knight contributed reporting.",

One of his famous quirks was creating his own personal regiment of extremely tall men, known to history as the \u201cPotsdam Giants.\u201d\n\nPeter the Great knew of Frederick\u2019s passion. After the 1716 negotiations on the alliance of Russia and Prussia against Sweden in the Great Northern War, Peter sent home a letter to the Governing Senate (a council of officials that ruled the country in the absence of the tsar), ordering to find 200 Russian \u201ctall muzhiks\u201d to be sent to Prussia to serve the king.\n\nThe living toy soldiers\n\nPortrait of Frederick William I of Prussia by Antoine Pesne (1683-1757) Antoine Pesne/German Historical Museum Antoine Pesne/German Historical Museum\n\nAlong with the letter, Peter sent a paper ribbon that defined the minimum necessary height \u2013 193.5cm (6\u20193\u201d). The Senate then issued an order to find 211 men of such height or taller, no older than 50 years, in different parts of Russia.\n\nOnly about 60 men of necessary height were found , and 54 or 55 of them indeed were sent to Prussia in 1718. Along with the men, Peter sent to Frederick a wooden goblet carved by Peter himself, and a lathe machine. The presents and the men were given to Frederick during a pompous ceremony. Alexander Golovkin, Russian ambassador to Prussia, wrote that \u201cHis majesty accepted the presents with great gratitude, joy, and curiosity. He praised the arms, the uniforms and the stance of the men. He ranged the grenadiers by their height and sent them to Potsdam immediately.\u201d What was their fate there?\n\nKing Frederick William I of Prussia inspecting his giant guards, known as the Grand Grenadiers Of Potsdam, although most called them The Potsdam Giants. Legion Media Legion Media\n\nThe official name of Frederick William\u2019s regiment was \u201cThe Grand Grenadiers of Potsdam,\u201d but they were widely known as the \u201cPotsdam Giants,\u201d or simply \u201cThe Tall Fellows\u201d (\"Lange Kerls\" in German). The only requirement for joining the regiment was that soldiers had to be over six feet (182cm) tall, and their rate of pay was determined by nothing but their height \u2013 the taller, the higher was the pay.\n\nThe portrait of James Kirkland from Ireland of the Potsdam Giants by Johann Christof Merck Johann Christof Merck Johann Christof Merck\n\n\u201cThe Tall Fellows\u201d were not only Russian, of course \u2013 they were bought or even kidnapped by the king\u2019s enforcers from different countries of Europe. One of the tallest Giants (7\u2019'1\u201d), historians say, was an Irishman James Kirkland. He was offered a job as a footman to Baron Borck, the Prussian ambassador to London, but was captured and transported to the continent to become one of the \u201cTall Fellows.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: How Peter's 'Toy Army' brought Russia glory\n\nThe \u201cGiants\u201d were given the best food and accommodation, dressed in exclusively knit blue-and-red uniforms, boots with thick heels and 45cm (18\u201d) tall caps \u2013 to make them appear even taller. However, they never took part in real military action \u2013 Frederick William cherished them too much. They were only obliged to march at military parades at the king\u2019s court and were something like living toys \u2013 for example, when the king felt sick, they were ordered to march through his room.\n\nThe questionable fate of the Russian \u2018Giants\u2019\n\nThe portrait of Svirid Rodionov from Moscow of the Potsdam Giants by Johann Christof Merck Johann Christof Merck Johann Christof Merck\n\nRussia continued to send tall muzhiks to the Prussian king to support the king\u2019s strange obsession and uphold the military union with Prussia. Around 400 recruits were sent to Prussia during Peter\u2019s reign only. Not all of them were deemed tall enough for the Potsdam Giants\u2019 regiment and most went to the regular Prussian army.\n\nMany of these soldiers had families and relatives in Russia; they wrote back home, asking to be returned. In 1723, Peter asked Frederick William to send back at least 152 of the \u201ctall fellows,\u201d and promised to replace them with \u201csimple\u201d recruits. Frederick, however, was reluctant to do this. The traces of most of the soldiers who were sent to the field regiments were lost already \u2013 Russians didn\u2019t keep exact records on the recruits that were \u201cpresented\u201d to Frederick William, while the Prussians lost many of the records due to wartime conditions. Only about 95 Russians returned home in 1724.\n\nHowever, even after Peter\u2019s death, Russia continued to search for tall soldiers and send them to Prussia. We have a portrait of one of these men, a Muscovite called Svirid Rodionov, who was sent to Prussia no earlier than 1723; his portrait was painted in 1724 or later.\n\nMembers of the Registered Association re-enactment guard of the \"Tall Fellows\" from Potsdam, Germany. Hoppe Garden, Germany Legion Media Legion Media\n\nOrders to look for tall guys were given by Catherine I in 1725, and then Anna Ioannovna, who even allowed Prussian officers to come to Russia to look for tall recruits and take them away.\n\nWhen Frederick died in 1740, his \u201cPotsdam Giants\u201d counted about 3,800 men. His son, Frederick II the Great, considered the regiment to be an unnecessary expense. He downgraded the regiment to a battalion, and integrated most of its soldiers into other military units. What\u2019s more, Frederick II and Elizaveta Petrovna, the new Russian Empress, didn\u2019t get along too well. In 1746, Elizaveta demanded the return of the Russians serving in the Prussian army \u2013 Frederick II refused and didn\u2019t even answer in which units the Russians served.ly, Sadly, only a small number of the Russian \u201cTall Fellows\u201d were able to return home. Svirid Rodionov, for example, didn\u2019t see the golden domes of Moscow again \u2013 he reportedly met his later years in Verder, Prussia.\n\nIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material.",

(Ksenia Ivanova for The Washington Post)\n\nTwo weeks before the start of his 25th year as Russia\u2019s supreme political leader, Vladimir Putin made a sweeping proclamation: \u201cWars are won by teachers.\u201d The remark, which Putin repeated twice during his year-end news conference in December, shed light on a campaign he is waging that has received little attention outside wartime Russia: to imbue the country\u2019s education system with patriotism, purge universities of Western influences, and quash any dissent among professors and students on campuses that are often hotbeds of political activism.\n\nAt St. Petersburg State University, this meant dismantling a prestigious humanities program called the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences. For more than a decade, until May 2022, the faculty \u2014 or college \u2014 was led by Alexei Kudrin, a liberal economist and former finance minister who had been a close associate of Putin\u2019s since the early 1990s, when they were deputy mayors together in St. Petersburg.\n\n\u201cWe had many classes on U.S. history, American political life, democracy and political thought, as well as courses on Russian history and political science, history of U.S.-Russian relations, and even a course titled \u2018The ABCs of War: Causes, Effects, Consequences,\u2019\u201d said a student at the faculty, also known as Smolny College. \u201cThey are all gone now,\u201d the student said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nSkip to end of carousel About this series \u201cRussia, Remastered\u201d examines how Vladimir Putin, stoking conflict with the West and risking a new world war, is harnessing his invasion of Ukraine to transform Russia and fulfill his revanchist vision of a restored superpower. End of carousel In a radical reshaping of Russia\u2019s education system, curriculums are being redrawn to stress patriotism and textbooks rewritten to belittle Ukraine, glorify Russia and whitewash the totalitarian Soviet past. These changes \u2014 the most sweeping to schooling in Russia since the 1930s \u2014 are a core part of Putin\u2019s effort to harness the war in Ukraine to remaster his country as a regressive, militarized state.\n\nSince the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leaders of Russian universities, which are overwhelmingly funded by the state, have zealously adopted the Kremlin\u2019s intolerance of any dissent or self-organization, according to an extensive examination by The Washington Post of events on campuses across Russia, including interviews with students and professors both still in the country and in exile.\n\nProfessors who spoke out against the war, or allowed safe spaces for students to question it, have been fired. Students who picketed or posted on social media for peace were expelled.\n\nMeanwhile, those who volunteer to fight in Ukraine have been celebrated in line with Putin\u2019s promises that war heroes and their descendants will become the new Russian elite, with enhanced social benefits, including special preference for children seeking to enter top academic programs. Normally, such programs require near-perfect grades and high scores on competitive exams \u2014 uniform standards that applicants from all societal backgrounds have relied on for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the most fundamental precept of academic life \u2014 the freedom to think independently, to challenge conventional assumptions and pursue new, bold ideas \u2014 has been eroded by edicts that classrooms become echo chambers of the authoritarian nativism and historical distortions that Putin uses to justify his war and his will.\n\nAs a result, a system of higher learning that once was a beacon for students across the developing world is now shutting itself off from peer academies in the West, severing one of the few ties that had survived years of political turbulence. Freedom of thought is being trampled, if not eradicated. Eminent scholars have fled for positions abroad, while others said in interviews that they are planning to do so.\n\nAt the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, officials last July created the Ivan Ilyin Higher Political School, which is now being led by Alexander Dugin, a fervent pro-Putin and Orthodox Christian ideologue who was tasked with \u201crevising domestic scientific and educational paradigms and bringing them into line with our traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been a catastrophic degradation in Western humanitarian history,\u201d Dugin said at a January seminar on transforming Russian humanities education. \u201cThis is evidenced by gender problems, postmodernism and ultraliberalism. We can study the West, but not as the ultimate universal truth. We need to focus on our own Russian development model.\u201d\n\nSkip to end of carousel How we reported \u2018Russia, Remastered\u2019 arrow left arrow right For this article, Russia reporter Mary Iluyshina reported from Riga, Latvia, and Berlin, communicating by phone and social media with Russian students and professors in the country and those who have fled. Many experienced the transformation of Russia\u2019s educational system firsthand. Information they provided was corroborated by court documents, independent Russian news accounts, social media posts, and other documentary evidence. The Post also relied on Kremlin transcripts of remarks by President Vladimir, government decrees, and official statements issued by universities. Photographer Ksenia Ivanova reported from St. Petersburg. Reporting on Russia is challenging, and it has grown more difficult since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At times, people in Russia are afraid to speak with journalists or to say things that they worry could provoke the authorities. Many people in Russia avoid speaking in public about politics or the war in Ukraine, fearing they could be reported to the authorities by neighbors or by classmates . Some analysts still inside the country are known to comment carefully, wary of provoking the Kremlin. For these reasons, The Post agreed to withhold the identities of some people interviewed who expressed concerns about their safety. For those reluctant to meet in person because of security concerns, we agreed to conduct interviews on encrypted internet platforms. Mary Ilyushina, a Post reporter covering Russia since 2021, previously worked for CNN\u2019s Moscow bureau as a field producer. She speaks Russian, English, Ukrainian and Arabic and is a graduate of Moscow State University. Robyn Dixon, The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau chief since November 2019, is on her third stint covering Russia, having had previous assignments with the Los Angeles Times and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age dating back to 1993. She speaks Russian, French and English. Francesca Ebel, a Russia correspondent for The Post since November 2022, previously covered Russia and Ukraine as a multimedia journalist for the Associated Press was an AP correspondent based in Tunis. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in medieval and modern languages from Cambridge University, where she studied Russian, Ukrainian and French. Natalia Abbakumova has been a researcher and translator in The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau since 2001, collaborating during that time with 10 bureau chiefs. Previously, she worked briefly for The Economist. She holds a degree in foreign languages (English and German) from Moscow Linguistic University. 1 / 4 End of carousel Last month, students pushed an online petition to protest the naming of the school after Ilyin, a philosopher who defended Hitler and Mussolini in World War II and advocated for the return of czarist autocracy in Russia. In a statement to Tass, the state-controlled news service, the university denounced the petition as \u201cpart of the information war of the West and its supporters against Russia\u201d and asserted, without providing evidence, that the group behind it had no connection to students at the school. Programs specializing in the liberal arts and sciences are primary targets because they are viewed as breeding grounds for dissent. Major universities have cut the hours spent studying Western governments, human rights and international law, and even the English language. \u201cWe were destroyed,\u201d said Denis Skopin, a philosophy professor at Smolny College who was fired for criticizing the war. \u201cBecause the last thing people who run universities need are unreliable actors who do the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing, think in a different way, and teach their students to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College\n\nSt. Petersburg State University, commonly known as SPbU, has long been one of Russia\u2019s premier academies of higher learning. It is the alma mater of both Putin, who graduated with a degree in law in 1975, and former president Dmitry Medvedev, who received his law degree 12 years later and now routinely threatens nuclear strikes on the West as deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s national security council.\n\nIn many ways, the university has become the leader in reprisals against students and staff not loyal to the Kremlin, with one newspaper dubbing it the \u201crepressions champion\u201d of Russian education. Its halls have become a microcosm of modern Russia in which conservatives in power are pushing out the few remaining Western-oriented liberals.\n\nLike other aspects of Putin\u2019s remastering of Russia \u2014 such as patriotic mandates in the arts and the redrawing of the role of women to focus on childbearing \u2014 the shift in education started well before the invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, Russia ended a more than 20-year-old exchange program between Smolny College and Bard College in New York state by designating the private American liberal arts school an \u201cundesirable\u201d organization.\n\nJonathan Becker, Bard\u2019s vice president for academic affairs and a professor of political studies, said the demise of Smolny was emblematic of a wider shift in Russia as well as a new intolerance of the West.\n\n\u201cA huge number of faculty have been let go, several departments closed, core liberal arts programs which focus on critical thinking have been eliminated,\u201d Becker said. \u201cAll of that has happened, and it\u2019s not just happened at Smolny \u2014 it has happened elsewhere. But we were doubly problematic because we both represent critical thinking and partnership with the West. And neither of those are acceptable in present-day Russia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2022, in a scene captured on video and posted on social media, dozens of students gathered in a courtyard to bid a tearful goodbye to Skopin, Smolny\u2019s cherished philosophy professor who was fired for an \u201cimmoral act\u201d \u2014 protesting Putin\u2019s announcement of a partial military mobilization to replenish his depleted forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe month before, according to court records and interviews, Skopin was arrested at an antiwar rally. He ended up sharing a jail cell with another professor, Artem Kalmykov, a young mathematician who had recently finished his PhD at the University of Zurich.\n\nThat fall, the university launched an overhaul that all but shut Smolny College and replaced the curriculum with a thoroughly revamped arts and humanities program.\n\nThe dismantling of Smolny marked the resolution of a years-long feud between Kudrin, the liberal-economist dean, and Nikolai Kropachev, the university rector, whom tutors and students described as a volatile character with a passion for building ties in the highest echelons of the government.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College\n\nIn February, Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service, sent a heartfelt birthday message to Kropachev, thanking him for his \u201ccivic and political activity\u201d and for \u201ccomprehensive assistance in replenishing personnel.\u201d\n\nOne student described how Kropachev once interrupted a meeting with students and hinted that he needed to take a call from Putin, in what the student viewed as a boast of his direct access to the Russian leader. Both St. Petersburg State University and Moscow State University were assigned a special status in 2009, under which their rectors are appointed personally by the president.\n\nSkopin, who earned his PhD in France, and his cellmate, Kalmykov, were perfect examples of the type of academic that Russia aspired to attract from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s \u2014 enticed after studying abroad to bring knowledge home amid booming investment in higher education. But by 2022, the system seemed to have no need for them.\n\nVideo of the gathering in the courtyard shows students erupting in sustained applause, and one student coming forward to hug Skopin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it,\u201d Skopin said.\n\nAfter his dismissal, some students tried to fight the administration\u2019s plan to dismantle the Smolny program.\n\n\u201cAt one point we found ourselves in a situation where out of 30 original faculty staff, we had just three tutors left,\u201d said Polina Ulanovskaya, a sociology student and activist who led the student union. \u201cAnd the quality of education definitely suffered, especially all of the politics-related classes.\u201d\n\nUlanovskaya said that on the political science track, only two professors have stayed, and many classes were eliminated, including a human rights course. There are now just two courses offered in English, down from 21.\n\nWith every new professor, Ulanovskaya said, she felt a need to test the waters. Would the word \u201cgender\u201d trigger them? Could she say something opposition-leaning? What would be a red flag?\n\nUlanovskaya opted out of writing a thesis on her main research topic \u2014 Russian social movements, politicization of workers and historic-preservation activists \u2014 out of fear that it would be blacklisted. Instead, she wrote about Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe main problem at the faculty now is that there is no freedom and especially no sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess there is no such thing anywhere in Russia now ... you can\u2019t trust anyone in any university.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after The Post interviewed Ulanovskaya last fall, she was expelled, formally for failing an exam, but she and Skopin said they believe it was retaliation for her activism.\n\nAnother student, Yelizaveta Antonova, was supposed to get her bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism just days after legendary Novaya Gazeta newspaper reporter Yelena Milashina was brutally beaten in Chechnya, the small Muslim-majority republic in southern Russia under the dictatorial rule of Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nAntonova, who interned at Novaya Gazeta and looked up to Milashina, felt she could not accept her diploma without showing support for her colleague. She and a roommate printed a photo of Milashina, depicting the reporter\u2019s shaved head and bandaged hands, to stage a demonstration at their graduation ceremony \u2014 much to the dismay of other classmates, who sought to block the protest.\n\n\u201cThey essentially prevented us from going on stage,\u201d Antonova said. \u201cSo we did it outside of the law school, and we felt it was extra symbolic because Putin and Medvedev studied in these halls.\u201d\n\nThey held up the poster for about half an hour, until another student threatened them by saying riot police were on the way to arrest them. Antonova believes the protest cost her a spot in graduate school, where she hoped to continue her research comparing Russia\u2019s media landscape before and after the invasion.\n\nEight months after the graduation ceremony, authorities launched a case against Antonova and her roommate for staging an unauthorized demonstration \u2014 an administrative offense that is punishable by a fine and puts people on law enforcement\u2019s radar. Antonova left the country to continue her studies abroad.\n\nIdeological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides\n\nThe history college at St. Petersburg State has long been a battleground for various ideologies, with cliques ranging from conservatives and Kremlin loyalists to unyielding opposition-minded liberals, according to interviews with students and professors.\n\nThe February 2022 invasion of Ukraine caused a deeper split. Some students and professors openly praised Putin\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d as the Kremlin called the war, while others joined rallies against it.\n\n\u201cThe war gave them carte blanche,\u201d said Michael Martin, 22, a former star at the college \u2014 to which he was automatically admitted after winning two nationwide academic competitions and where he earned straight A\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartin was a leader of the student council, which on the day of the invasion issued an antiwar manifesto quickly drafted in a cafe.\n\nAnother history student, Fedor Solomonov, took the opposite view and praised the special military operation on social media. When Solomonov was called up as part of the mobilization, he declined to take a student deferral and went to fight. He died on the front on April 1, 2023.\n\nSoon after Solomonov\u2019s death, screenshots from internal chats where students often debated history and politics were leaked and went viral on pro-war Telegram channels. In some, Martin and other classmates expressed antiwar sentiments, while another showed a message \u2014 allegedly written by an assistant professor, Mikhail Belousov \u2014 vaguely describing events in Ukraine as \u201cRashism,\u201d a wordplay combining \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201cfascism.\u201d\n\nIn an aggressive online campaign, pro-war activists demanded that Belousov, who denied writing the message, be fired and that the antiwar students, whom they labeled \u201ca pro-Ukrainian organized crime group,\u201d be expelled.\n\n\u201cA cell of anti-Russian students led by a Russophobe associate professor is operating at the history faculty,\u201d read posts on Readovka, a radical outlet with 2.5 million followers. \u201cThey are rabid liberals who hate their country.\u201d Belousov was dismissed and seven students, including Martin, were accused of desecrating Solomonov\u2019s memory and expelled.\n\nBelousov has gone underground and could not be reached for comment.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThey essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil,\u201d Martin said, recalling the expulsion hearing, where he said the committee repeatedly asked leading questions trying to get him to say the war was justified. The committee also asked him repeatedly about Solomonov.\n\n\u201cI said he was for the war and I was against it \u2014 we could argue about that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t find anything funny or interesting in this \u2014 I\u2019m truly sorry for what happened to him, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that he did something good or great by going to war.\u201d\n\nMartin said that as the war raged on, the university began \u201cglorifying death\u201d and praising alumni who had joined the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis narrative also warped the curriculum.\n\nA few weeks into the invasion, the school introduced a class on modern Ukrainian history, with a course description asserting that Ukrainian statehood is based \u201con a certain mythology.\u201d\n\n\u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University\n\nBelousov, the former assistant professor, criticized a course titled \u201cThe Great Patriotic War: No Statute of Limitations,\u201d taught by an instructor with a degree in library science. The key message of the course is that the Soviet Union had no role in the start of World War II \u2014 a denial of Russia\u2019s joint invasion of Poland with Nazi Germany in 1939.\n\nAccording to a government document reviewed by The Post, Russia\u2019s Higher Education Ministry plans to introduce this course at other universities to ensure the \u201ccivic-patriotic and spiritual-moral education of youth,\u201d specifically future lawyers, teachers and historians, and to \u201ccorrect false ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are obviously propaganda courses that are aimed at turning historians into court apologists,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMartin was expelled days before he was supposed to defend his thesis. He quickly left the country after warnings that he and his classmates could be charged with discrediting the army, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. A criminal case was initiated against Belousov on charges of rehabilitating Nazism.\n\n\u201cThis is all very reminiscent of the Stalinist 1930s purges,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe limit of tolerated protest now is to sit silently and say nothing. There is despair at the faculty and a feeling that they have crushed everything.\u201d\n\nNew Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite\n\nTo lure more Russian men to fight in Ukraine, the government has promised their families various sweeteners, including cheap mortgages, large life insurance payments and education benefits for their children.\n\nIn 2022, Putin approved changes to education laws to grant children of soldiers who fought in Ukraine admissions preferences at Russia\u2019s best universities \u2014 schools that normally accept only students with near-perfect exam scores and impressive high school records.\n\nNow, at least 10 percent of all fully funded university spots must be allocated to students eligible for the military preference. Those whose fathers were killed or wounded do not need to pass entry exams.\n\nThe new law solidified a previous Putin decree that gave special preferences to soldiers and their children. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 8,500 students were enrolled based on these preferences, government officials said. According to an investigation by the Russian-language outlet Important Stories, nearly 900 students were admitted to 13 top universities through war quotas, with most failing to meet the normal exam score threshold.\n\nIn areas of Ukraine captured by Russian forces since February 2022, a different takeover of the education system is underway, with Moscow imposing its curriculum and standards just as it did after invading and illegally annexing Crimea in 2014.\n\nFor the 2023-24 academic year, according to the Russian prime minister\u2019s office, more than 5 percent of fully state-financed tuition stipends \u2014 roughly 37,000 out of 626,000 \u2014 were allocated for students at universities in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson or Zaporizhzhia, the four occupied or partly occupied areas of Ukraine that Putin has claimed to be annexed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relatively large allocation of tuition aid in occupied areas shows how financial assistance and education are central to Putin\u2019s effort to seize lands in southeast Ukraine and absorb its population into Russia in violation of international law.\n\nDeans of several leading Russian universities have made highly publicized trips to occupied Ukraine to urge students there to enroll into Russian schools, part of a multipronged effort to bring residents into Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe Moscow-based Higher School of Economics, once considered Russia\u2019s most liberal university, recently established patronage over universities in Luhansk, with Rector Nikita Anisimov often traveling there.\n\nAn inward turn An inward turn An inward turn An inward turn\n\nA few weeks after the invasion started, Moscow abandoned the Bologna Process, a pan-European effort to align higher education standards, as Russia\u2019s deans and rectors strove to show they weren\u2019t susceptible to foreign influence.\n\nHigher Education Minister Valery Falkov said Russian universities would undergo significant changes in the next half-decade, overseen by the national program \u201cPriority 2030,\u201d which envisions curriculums that ensure \u201cformation of a patriotic worldview in young people.\u201d\n\nSoon after Russia quit the Bologna Process, Smolny College was targeted for overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe decision was an expected but distinct shift from the more liberal model of Russian higher education policy that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union,\u201d said Victoria Pardini, a program associate at the Kennan Institute, a Washington think tank focused on Russia.\n\nAnother prestigious school, the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, canceled its liberal arts program in 2022 after authorities accused it of \u201cdestroying national values.\u201d\n\nIn mid-October 2023, the Higher Education Ministry ordered universities to avoid open discussion of \u201cnegative political, economic and social trends,\u201d according to a publicly disclosed report by British intelligence. \u201cIn the longer term, this will likely further the trend of Russian policymaking taking place in an echo-chamber,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nRussia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge\n\nMany international exchange programs have been canceled \u2014 some because Russian students now have difficulty obtaining visas.

(Ksenia Ivanova for The Washington Post)\n\nTwo weeks before the start of his 25th year as Russia\u2019s supreme political leader, Vladimir Putin made a sweeping proclamation: \u201cWars are won by teachers.\u201d The remark, which Putin repeated twice during his year-end news conference in December, shed light on a campaign he is waging that has received little attention outside wartime Russia: to imbue the country\u2019s education system with patriotism, purge universities of Western influences, and quash any dissent among professors and students on campuses that are often hotbeds of political activism.\n\nAt St. Petersburg State University, this meant dismantling a prestigious humanities program called the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences. For more than a decade, until May 2022, the faculty \u2014 or college \u2014 was led by Alexei Kudrin, a liberal economist and former finance minister who had been a close associate of Putin\u2019s since the early 1990s, when they were deputy mayors together in St. Petersburg.\n\n\u201cWe had many classes on U.S. history, American political life, democracy and political thought, as well as courses on Russian history and political science, history of U.S.-Russian relations, and even a course titled \u2018The ABCs of War: Causes, Effects, Consequences,\u2019\u201d said a student at the faculty, also known as Smolny College. \u201cThey are all gone now,\u201d the student said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nSkip to end of carousel About this series \u201cRussia, Remastered\u201d examines how Vladimir Putin, stoking conflict with the West and risking a new world war, is harnessing his invasion of Ukraine to transform Russia and fulfill his revanchist vision of a restored superpower. End of carousel In a radical reshaping of Russia\u2019s education system, curriculums are being redrawn to stress patriotism and textbooks rewritten to belittle Ukraine, glorify Russia and whitewash the totalitarian Soviet past. These changes \u2014 the most sweeping to schooling in Russia since the 1930s \u2014 are a core part of Putin\u2019s effort to harness the war in Ukraine to remaster his country as a regressive, militarized state.\n\nSince the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leaders of Russian universities, which are overwhelmingly funded by the state, have zealously adopted the Kremlin\u2019s intolerance of any dissent or self-organization, according to an extensive examination by The Washington Post of events on campuses across Russia, including interviews with students and professors both still in the country and in exile.\n\nProfessors who spoke out against the war, or allowed safe spaces for students to question it, have been fired. Students who picketed or posted on social media for peace were expelled.\n\nMeanwhile, those who volunteer to fight in Ukraine have been celebrated in line with Putin\u2019s promises that war heroes and their descendants will become the new Russian elite, with enhanced social benefits, including special preference for children seeking to enter top academic programs. Normally, such programs require near-perfect grades and high scores on competitive exams \u2014 uniform standards that applicants from all societal backgrounds have relied on for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the most fundamental precept of academic life \u2014 the freedom to think independently, to challenge conventional assumptions and pursue new, bold ideas \u2014 has been eroded by edicts that classrooms become echo chambers of the authoritarian nativism and historical distortions that Putin uses to justify his war and his will.\n\nAs a result, a system of higher learning that once was a beacon for students across the developing world is now shutting itself off from peer academies in the West, severing one of the few ties that had survived years of political turbulence. Freedom of thought is being trampled, if not eradicated. Eminent scholars have fled for positions abroad, while others said in interviews that they are planning to do so.\n\nAt the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, officials last July created the Ivan Ilyin Higher Political School, which is now being led by Alexander Dugin, a fervent pro-Putin and Orthodox Christian ideologue who was tasked with \u201crevising domestic scientific and educational paradigms and bringing them into line with our traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been a catastrophic degradation in Western humanitarian history,\u201d Dugin said at a January seminar on transforming Russian humanities education. \u201cThis is evidenced by gender problems, postmodernism and ultraliberalism. We can study the West, but not as the ultimate universal truth. We need to focus on our own Russian development model.\u201d\n\nSkip to end of carousel How we reported \u2018Russia, Remastered\u2019 arrow left arrow right For this article, Russia reporter Mary Iluyshina reported from Riga, Latvia, and Berlin, communicating by phone and social media with Russian students and professors in the country and those who have fled. Many experienced the transformation of Russia\u2019s educational system firsthand. Information they provided was corroborated by court documents, independent Russian news accounts, social media posts, and other documentary evidence. The Post also relied on Kremlin transcripts of remarks by President Vladimir, government decrees, and official statements issued by universities. Photographer Ksenia Ivanova reported from St. Petersburg. Reporting on Russia is challenging, and it has grown more difficult since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At times, people in Russia are afraid to speak with journalists or to say things that they worry could provoke the authorities. Many people in Russia avoid speaking in public about politics or the war in Ukraine, fearing they could be reported to the authorities by neighbors or by classmates . Some analysts still inside the country are known to comment carefully, wary of provoking the Kremlin. For these reasons, The Post agreed to withhold the identities of some people interviewed who expressed concerns about their safety. For those reluctant to meet in person because of security concerns, we agreed to conduct interviews on encrypted internet platforms. Mary Ilyushina, a Post reporter covering Russia since 2021, previously worked for CNN\u2019s Moscow bureau as a field producer. She speaks Russian, English, Ukrainian and Arabic and is a graduate of Moscow State University. Robyn Dixon, The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau chief since November 2019, is on her third stint covering Russia, having had previous assignments with the Los Angeles Times and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age dating back to 1993. She speaks Russian, French and English. Francesca Ebel, a Russia correspondent for The Post since November 2022, previously covered Russia and Ukraine as a multimedia journalist for the Associated Press was an AP correspondent based in Tunis. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in medieval and modern languages from Cambridge University, where she studied Russian, Ukrainian and French. Natalia Abbakumova has been a researcher and translator in The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau since 2001, collaborating during that time with 10 bureau chiefs. Previously, she worked briefly for The Economist. She holds a degree in foreign languages (English and German) from Moscow Linguistic University. 1 / 4 End of carousel Last month, students pushed an online petition to protest the naming of the school after Ilyin, a philosopher who defended Hitler and Mussolini in World War II and advocated for the return of czarist autocracy in Russia. In a statement to Tass, the state-controlled news service, the university denounced the petition as \u201cpart of the information war of the West and its supporters against Russia\u201d and asserted, without providing evidence, that the group behind it had no connection to students at the school. Programs specializing in the liberal arts and sciences are primary targets because they are viewed as breeding grounds for dissent. Major universities have cut the hours spent studying Western governments, human rights and international law, and even the English language. \u201cWe were destroyed,\u201d said Denis Skopin, a philosophy professor at Smolny College who was fired for criticizing the war. \u201cBecause the last thing people who run universities need are unreliable actors who do the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing, think in a different way, and teach their students to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College\n\nSt. Petersburg State University, commonly known as SPbU, has long been one of Russia\u2019s premier academies of higher learning. It is the alma mater of both Putin, who graduated with a degree in law in 1975, and former president Dmitry Medvedev, who received his law degree 12 years later and now routinely threatens nuclear strikes on the West as deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s national security council.\n\nIn many ways, the university has become the leader in reprisals against students and staff not loyal to the Kremlin, with one newspaper dubbing it the \u201crepressions champion\u201d of Russian education. Its halls have become a microcosm of modern Russia in which conservatives in power are pushing out the few remaining Western-oriented liberals.\n\nLike other aspects of Putin\u2019s remastering of Russia \u2014 such as patriotic mandates in the arts and the redrawing of the role of women to focus on childbearing \u2014 the shift in education started well before the invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, Russia ended a more than 20-year-old exchange program between Smolny College and Bard College in New York state by designating the private American liberal arts school an \u201cundesirable\u201d organization.\n\nJonathan Becker, Bard\u2019s vice president for academic affairs and a professor of political studies, said the demise of Smolny was emblematic of a wider shift in Russia as well as a new intolerance of the West.\n\n\u201cA huge number of faculty have been let go, several departments closed, core liberal arts programs which focus on critical thinking have been eliminated,\u201d Becker said. \u201cAll of that has happened, and it\u2019s not just happened at Smolny \u2014 it has happened elsewhere. But we were doubly problematic because we both represent critical thinking and partnership with the West. And neither of those are acceptable in present-day Russia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2022, in a scene captured on video and posted on social media, dozens of students gathered in a courtyard to bid a tearful goodbye to Skopin, Smolny\u2019s cherished philosophy professor who was fired for an \u201cimmoral act\u201d \u2014 protesting Putin\u2019s announcement of a partial military mobilization to replenish his depleted forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe month before, according to court records and interviews, Skopin was arrested at an antiwar rally. He ended up sharing a jail cell with another professor, Artem Kalmykov, a young mathematician who had recently finished his PhD at the University of Zurich.\n\nThat fall, the university launched an overhaul that all but shut Smolny College and replaced the curriculum with a thoroughly revamped arts and humanities program.\n\nThe dismantling of Smolny marked the resolution of a years-long feud between Kudrin, the liberal-economist dean, and Nikolai Kropachev, the university rector, whom tutors and students described as a volatile character with a passion for building ties in the highest echelons of the government.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College\n\nIn February, Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service, sent a heartfelt birthday message to Kropachev, thanking him for his \u201ccivic and political activity\u201d and for \u201ccomprehensive assistance in replenishing personnel.\u201d\n\nOne student described how Kropachev once interrupted a meeting with students and hinted that he needed to take a call from Putin, in what the student viewed as a boast of his direct access to the Russian leader. Both St. Petersburg State University and Moscow State University were assigned a special status in 2009, under which their rectors are appointed personally by the president.\n\nSkopin, who earned his PhD in France, and his cellmate, Kalmykov, were perfect examples of the type of academic that Russia aspired to attract from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s \u2014 enticed after studying abroad to bring knowledge home amid booming investment in higher education. But by 2022, the system seemed to have no need for them.\n\nVideo of the gathering in the courtyard shows students erupting in sustained applause, and one student coming forward to hug Skopin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it,\u201d Skopin said.\n\nAfter his dismissal, some students tried to fight the administration\u2019s plan to dismantle the Smolny program.\n\n\u201cAt one point we found ourselves in a situation where out of 30 original faculty staff, we had just three tutors left,\u201d said Polina Ulanovskaya, a sociology student and activist who led the student union. \u201cAnd the quality of education definitely suffered, especially all of the politics-related classes.\u201d\n\nUlanovskaya said that on the political science track, only two professors have stayed, and many classes were eliminated, including a human rights course. There are now just two courses offered in English, down from 21.\n\nWith every new professor, Ulanovskaya said, she felt a need to test the waters. Would the word \u201cgender\u201d trigger them? Could she say something opposition-leaning? What would be a red flag?\n\nUlanovskaya opted out of writing a thesis on her main research topic \u2014 Russian social movements, politicization of workers and historic-preservation activists \u2014 out of fear that it would be blacklisted. Instead, she wrote about Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe main problem at the faculty now is that there is no freedom and especially no sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess there is no such thing anywhere in Russia now ... you can\u2019t trust anyone in any university.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after The Post interviewed Ulanovskaya last fall, she was expelled, formally for failing an exam, but she and Skopin said they believe it was retaliation for her activism.\n\nAnother student, Yelizaveta Antonova, was supposed to get her bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism just days after legendary Novaya Gazeta newspaper reporter Yelena Milashina was brutally beaten in Chechnya, the small Muslim-majority republic in southern Russia under the dictatorial rule of Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nAntonova, who interned at Novaya Gazeta and looked up to Milashina, felt she could not accept her diploma without showing support for her colleague. She and a roommate printed a photo of Milashina, depicting the reporter\u2019s shaved head and bandaged hands, to stage a demonstration at their graduation ceremony \u2014 much to the dismay of other classmates, who sought to block the protest.\n\n\u201cThey essentially prevented us from going on stage,\u201d Antonova said. \u201cSo we did it outside of the law school, and we felt it was extra symbolic because Putin and Medvedev studied in these halls.\u201d\n\nThey held up the poster for about half an hour, until another student threatened them by saying riot police were on the way to arrest them. Antonova believes the protest cost her a spot in graduate school, where she hoped to continue her research comparing Russia\u2019s media landscape before and after the invasion.\n\nEight months after the graduation ceremony, authorities launched a case against Antonova and her roommate for staging an unauthorized demonstration \u2014 an administrative offense that is punishable by a fine and puts people on law enforcement\u2019s radar. Antonova left the country to continue her studies abroad.\n\nIdeological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides\n\nThe history college at St. Petersburg State has long been a battleground for various ideologies, with cliques ranging from conservatives and Kremlin loyalists to unyielding opposition-minded liberals, according to interviews with students and professors.\n\nThe February 2022 invasion of Ukraine caused a deeper split. Some students and professors openly praised Putin\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d as the Kremlin called the war, while others joined rallies against it.\n\n\u201cThe war gave them carte blanche,\u201d said Michael Martin, 22, a former star at the college \u2014 to which he was automatically admitted after winning two nationwide academic competitions and where he earned straight A\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartin was a leader of the student council, which on the day of the invasion issued an antiwar manifesto quickly drafted in a cafe.\n\nAnother history student, Fedor Solomonov, took the opposite view and praised the special military operation on social media. When Solomonov was called up as part of the mobilization, he declined to take a student deferral and went to fight. He died on the front on April 1, 2023.\n\nSoon after Solomonov\u2019s death, screenshots from internal chats where students often debated history and politics were leaked and went viral on pro-war Telegram channels. In some, Martin and other classmates expressed antiwar sentiments, while another showed a message \u2014 allegedly written by an assistant professor, Mikhail Belousov \u2014 vaguely describing events in Ukraine as \u201cRashism,\u201d a wordplay combining \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201cfascism.\u201d\n\nIn an aggressive online campaign, pro-war activists demanded that Belousov, who denied writing the message, be fired and that the antiwar students, whom they labeled \u201ca pro-Ukrainian organized crime group,\u201d be expelled.\n\n\u201cA cell of anti-Russian students led by a Russophobe associate professor is operating at the history faculty,\u201d read posts on Readovka, a radical outlet with 2.5 million followers. \u201cThey are rabid liberals who hate their country.\u201d Belousov was dismissed and seven students, including Martin, were accused of desecrating Solomonov\u2019s memory and expelled.\n\nBelousov has gone underground and could not be reached for comment.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThey essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil,\u201d Martin said, recalling the expulsion hearing, where he said the committee repeatedly asked leading questions trying to get him to say the war was justified. The committee also asked him repeatedly about Solomonov.\n\n\u201cI said he was for the war and I was against it \u2014 we could argue about that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t find anything funny or interesting in this \u2014 I\u2019m truly sorry for what happened to him, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that he did something good or great by going to war.\u201d\n\nMartin said that as the war raged on, the university began \u201cglorifying death\u201d and praising alumni who had joined the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis narrative also warped the curriculum.\n\nA few weeks into the invasion, the school introduced a class on modern Ukrainian history, with a course description asserting that Ukrainian statehood is based \u201con a certain mythology.\u201d\n\n\u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University\n\nBelousov, the former assistant professor, criticized a course titled \u201cThe Great Patriotic War: No Statute of Limitations,\u201d taught by an instructor with a degree in library science. The key message of the course is that the Soviet Union had no role in the start of World War II \u2014 a denial of Russia\u2019s joint invasion of Poland with Nazi Germany in 1939.\n\nAccording to a government document reviewed by The Post, Russia\u2019s Higher Education Ministry plans to introduce this course at other universities to ensure the \u201ccivic-patriotic and spiritual-moral education of youth,\u201d specifically future lawyers, teachers and historians, and to \u201ccorrect false ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are obviously propaganda courses that are aimed at turning historians into court apologists,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMartin was expelled days before he was supposed to defend his thesis. He quickly left the country after warnings that he and his classmates could be charged with discrediting the army, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. A criminal case was initiated against Belousov on charges of rehabilitating Nazism.\n\n\u201cThis is all very reminiscent of the Stalinist 1930s purges,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe limit of tolerated protest now is to sit silently and say nothing. There is despair at the faculty and a feeling that they have crushed everything.\u201d\n\nNew Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite\n\nTo lure more Russian men to fight in Ukraine, the government has promised their families various sweeteners, including cheap mortgages, large life insurance payments and education benefits for their children.\n\nIn 2022, Putin approved changes to education laws to grant children of soldiers who fought in Ukraine admissions preferences at Russia\u2019s best universities \u2014 schools that normally accept only students with near-perfect exam scores and impressive high school records.\n\nNow, at least 10 percent of all fully funded university spots must be allocated to students eligible for the military preference. Those whose fathers were killed or wounded do not need to pass entry exams.\n\nThe new law solidified a previous Putin decree that gave special preferences to soldiers and their children. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 8,500 students were enrolled based on these preferences, government officials said. According to an investigation by the Russian-language outlet Important Stories, nearly 900 students were admitted to 13 top universities through war quotas, with most failing to meet the normal exam score threshold.\n\nIn areas of Ukraine captured by Russian forces since February 2022, a different takeover of the education system is underway, with Moscow imposing its curriculum and standards just as it did after invading and illegally annexing Crimea in 2014.\n\nFor the 2023-24 academic year, according to the Russian prime minister\u2019s office, more than 5 percent of fully state-financed tuition stipends \u2014 roughly 37,000 out of 626,000 \u2014 were allocated for students at universities in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson or Zaporizhzhia, the four occupied or partly occupied areas of Ukraine that Putin has claimed to be annexed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relatively large allocation of tuition aid in occupied areas shows how financial assistance and education are central to Putin\u2019s effort to seize lands in southeast Ukraine and absorb its population into Russia in violation of international law.\n\nDeans of several leading Russian universities have made highly publicized trips to occupied Ukraine to urge students there to enroll into Russian schools, part of a multipronged effort to bring residents into Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe Moscow-based Higher School of Economics, once considered Russia\u2019s most liberal university, recently established patronage over universities in Luhansk, with Rector Nikita Anisimov often traveling there.\n\nAn inward turn An inward turn An inward turn An inward turn\n\nA few weeks after the invasion started, Moscow abandoned the Bologna Process, a pan-European effort to align higher education standards, as Russia\u2019s deans and rectors strove to show they weren\u2019t susceptible to foreign influence.\n\nHigher Education Minister Valery Falkov said Russian universities would undergo significant changes in the next half-decade, overseen by the national program \u201cPriority 2030,\u201d which envisions curriculums that ensure \u201cformation of a patriotic worldview in young people.\u201d\n\nSoon after Russia quit the Bologna Process, Smolny College was targeted for overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe decision was an expected but distinct shift from the more liberal model of Russian higher education policy that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union,\u201d said Victoria Pardini, a program associate at the Kennan Institute, a Washington think tank focused on Russia.\n\nAnother prestigious school, the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, canceled its liberal arts program in 2022 after authorities accused it of \u201cdestroying national values.\u201d\n\nIn mid-October 2023, the Higher Education Ministry ordered universities to avoid open discussion of \u201cnegative political, economic and social trends,\u201d according to a publicly disclosed report by British intelligence. \u201cIn the longer term, this will likely further the trend of Russian policymaking taking place in an echo-chamber,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nRussia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge\n\nMany international exchange programs have been canceled \u2014 some because Russian students now have difficulty obtaining visas. Still, a heavy brain drain is underway. \u201cAll those who could \u2014 they left the country,\u201d Skopin said of his students. \u201cThose who can\u2019t are thrashing around as if they are in a cage.\u201d\n\nMartin is among those who got out \u2014 he was recently accepted into a prestigious master\u2019s program abroad and plans to continue his research into 19th-century Australian federalism.",

        "content": "AP \u2014 President Vladimir Putin began his fifth term at a glittering Kremlin inauguration Tuesday, embarking on another six years as leader of Russia after destroying his political opponents, launching a devastating war in Ukraine and concentrating all power in his hands.\n\nAt the ceremony in the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.\n\n\u201cWe are a united and great people and together we will overcome all obstacles, realize all our plans, together we will win,\u201d Putin said after being sworn in.\n\nSince succeeding President Boris Yeltsin in the waning hours of 1999, Putin has transformed Russia from a country emerging from economic collapse to a pariah state that threatens global security. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine that has become Europe\u00b4s biggest conflict since World War II, Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran and North Korea for support.\n\nAlready in office for nearly a quarter-century and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putin\u00b4s new term doesn\u00b4t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.\n\nIn a heavily choreographed performance, Putin was pictured in his office looking at his papers before walking along the Kremlin\u00b4s long corridors, pausing at one point to look at a painting, on the way to his inauguration.\n\nHis guard of honor waited in the sleet and rain for hours, in temperatures hovering just above freezing, while Putin made the brief journey to the Grand Kremlin Palace in his Auras limousine.\n\nPutin used the the first moments of his fifth term to thank the \u201cheroes\u201d of his war in Ukraine and to rail against the West.\n\nRussia \u201cdoes not refuse dialogue with Western states,\u201d he said. Rather, he said, \u201cthe choice is theirs: do they intend to continue trying to contain Russia, continue the policy of aggression, continuous pressure on our country for years, or look for a path to cooperation and peace.\u201d\n\nHe was greeted with applause when he entered the hall with more than 2,500 invited guests. They included senior members of the Russian government as well as celebrities including American actor Steven Seagal.\n\nNeither the U.S., U.K. nor German ambassadors attended. The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador Lynne Tracy was out of the country on \u201cprescheduled, personal travel.\u201d\n\nA handful of European Union envoys attended even though top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said he told them \u201cthe right thing to do is not to attend this inauguration,\u201d because Putin is the subject of an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.\n\nAmong those present was the French ambassador, according to a French diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nA 30-gun salute followed Putin\u2019s remarks. He reviewed the presidential regiment in the Kremlin\u2019s Cathedral Square in a light drizzle and then walked into nearby Annunciation Cathedral for a blessing from Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nDuring the brief service, Kirill compared Putin to Prince Alexander Nevsky, the medieval ruler who \u201ccourageously defended their people on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nHe reminded Putin that the head of state sometimes \u201chas to take fateful and formidable decisions\u201d that can lead to victims, an apparent reference to the many casualties in Ukraine \u2013 a conflict the church has endorsed.\n\nThe question now is what the 71-year-old Putin will do over the course of another six years in the Kremlin, both at home and abroad.\n\nRussian forces are gaining ground in Ukraine, deploying scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv grapples with shortages of men and ammunition.\n\nUkraine has brought the battle to Russian soil through drone and missile attacks, especially in border regions. In a speech in February, Putin vowed to fulfill Moscow\u00b4s goals in Ukraine, and do what is needed to \u201cdefend our sovereignty and security of our citizens.\u201d\n\nShortly after his orchestrated reelection in March, Putin suggested that a confrontation between NATO and Russia is possible, and he declared he wanted to carve out a buffer zone in Ukraine to protect his country from cross-border attacks.\n\nThe Russian government has now been dissolved so that Putin can name a new prime minister and Cabinet.\n\nOne key area to watch is the Defense Ministry.\n\nLast month, Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov \u2013 a protege of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu \u2013 was detained on charges of bribery amid reports of rampant corruption. Some analysts have suggested Shoigu could become a victim of the government reshuffle but that would be a bold move, with the war still raging.\n\nAt home, Putin\u2019s popularity is closely tied to improving living standards for ordinary Russians.\n\nPutin on Tuesday once again promised Russians a prosperous future, but since the invasion of Ukraine, many have seen the cost of living rise.\n\nPutin began his term in 2018 by promising to get Russia into the top five global economies, vowing it should be \u201cmodern and dynamic.\u201d Instead, Russia\u2019s economy has pivoted to a war footing, and authorities are spending record amounts on defense.\n\nAnalysts say now that Putin has secured another six years in power, the government could take the unpopular steps of raising taxes to fund the war and pressure more men to join the military.\n\nIn the years following the invasion, authorities have cracked down on any form of dissent with a ferocity not seen since Soviet times.\n\nPutin indicated Tuesday that he would continue to silence critics.\n\nHe told his audience in the Grand Kremlin Palace to remember the \u201ctragic cost of internal turmoil and upheaval,\u201d and said that Russia \u201cmust be strong and absolutely resistant to any challenges and threats.\u201d\n\nPutin enters his fifth term with practically no opposition inside the country.\n\nLaws have been enacted that threaten long prison terms for anyone who discredits the military. The Kremlin also targets independent media, rights groups, LGBTQ+ activists and others who don\u2019t hew to what Putin has emphasized as Russia\u2019s \u201ctraditional family values.\u201d\n\nHis greatest political foe, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony in February. Other prominent critics have either been imprisoned or have fled the country, and even some of his opponents abroad fear for their security.\n\nNavalny\u2019s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, released a video ahead of the inauguration in which she said Putin\u2019s promises \u201care not only empty, they are false.\u201d\n\nRussia, she said, is \u201cruled by a liar, a thief and a murderer.\u201d",

We are meant to think that Russia cannot lose.\n\nAnd far too many of us, during Russia\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine, have believed that. In February 2022, when Russia undertook its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, the consensus was that Ukraine would fall within days.\n\nEven today, when Ukraine has held its own for more than two years, the prevailing view among Russia\u2019s friends in Congress and in the Senate is that Russia must eventually win. Moscow\u2019s success is not on the battlefield, but in our minds.\n\nRussia can lose. And it should lose, for the sake of the world \u2014 and for its own sake.\n\nRussian soldiers patrol Mariupol's drama theater, southeastern Ukraine, in March 2022. Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe notion of an invincible Red Army is propaganda. The Red Army was formidable, but it was also beatable. Of its three most consequential foreign wars, the Red Army lost two.\n\nIt was defeated by Poland in 1920. It defeated Nazi Germany in 1945, after nearly collapsing in 1941. (Its win in that instance was part of a larger coalition and with decisive American economic assistance.) Soviet forces were in trouble in Afghanistan immediately after their 1979 invasion and had to withdraw a decade later.\n\nAnd the Russian army of today is not the Red Army. Russia is not the USSR. Soviet Ukraine was a source of resources and soldiers for the Red Army. In that victory of 1945, Ukrainian soldiers in the Red Army took huge losses \u2014 greater than American, British and French losses combined. It was disproportionately Ukrainians who fought their war to Berlin in the uniform of the Red Army.\n\nToday, Russia is fighting not together with Ukraine but against Ukraine. It is fighting a war of aggression on the territory of another state. And it lacks the American economic support \u2014 Lend-Lease \u2014 that the Red Army needed to defeat Nazi Germany. In this constellation, there is no particular reason to expect Russia to win. One would expect, instead, that Russia\u2019s only chance is to prevent the West from helping Ukraine \u2014 by persuading us that its victory is inevitable, so that we don\u2019t apply our decisive economic power.\n\nThe last six months bear this out: Russia\u2019s minor battlefield victories came at a time when the United States was delaying Ukraine aid, rather than supplying it.\n\nToday\u2019s Russia is a new state. It has existed since 1991. Like Brezhnev before him, Russian President Vladimir Putin rules through nostalgia. He refers to the Soviet and also the Russian imperial past. But the Russian Empire also lost wars. It lost the Crimean War in 1856. It lost the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It lost the First World War in 1917. In none of those three cases was Russia able to keep forces in the field for more than about three years.\n\nIn the United States there is great nervousness about a Russian defeat. If something seems impossible, we cannot imagine what could happen next. And so there is a tendency, even among supporters of Ukraine, to think that the best resolution is a tie.\n\nSuch thinking is unrealistic. And it reveals, behind the nerves, a strange American conceit.\n\nNo one can guide a war in such a way. And nothing in our prior attempts to influence Russia suggests that we can exercise that kind of influence. Russia and Ukraine are both fighting to win. The questions are: who will win, and with what consequences?\n\nIf Russia wins, the consequences are horrifying: a risk of a larger war in Europe, more likelihood of a Chinese adventure in the Pacific, the weakening of international legal order generally, the likely spread of nuclear weapons, the loss of faith in democracy.\n\nSoviet soldiers during a patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan, April 25, 1988. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in late 1979 and remained there until 1989. Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nIt is normal for Russia to lose wars. And, in general, this led Russians to reflect and reform. Defeat in Crimea forced an autocracy to end serfdom. Russia\u2019s loss to Japan led to an experiment with elections. The Soviet failure in Afghanistan led to Gorbachev\u2019s reforms and thus the end of the cold war.\n\nBeneath the Russian particularities, history offers a more general and still more reassuring lesson about empires. Russia is fighting today an imperial war. It denies the existence of the Ukrainian state and nation, and it carries out atrocities that recall the worst of the European imperial past.\n\nThe peaceful Europe of today consists of powers that lost their last imperial wars and then chose democracy. It is not only possible to lose your last imperial war: it is also good, not only for the world, but for you.\n\nRussia can lose this war, and should, for the sake of Russians themselves. A defeated Russia means not only the end of senseless losses of young life in Ukraine. It is also Russia\u2019s one chance to become a post-imperial country, one where reform is possible, one where Russians themselves might be protected by law and able to cast meaningful votes.\n\nDefeat in Ukraine is Russia\u2019s historical chance for normality \u2014 as Russians who want democracy and the rule of law will say.\n\nLike the United States and Europe, Ukraine celebrates the victory of 1945 on May 8th rather than May 9th. Ukrainians have every right to remember and interpret that victory: they suffered more than Russians from German occupation and died in huge numbers on the battlefield.\n\nAnd Ukrainians are right to think that Russia today, like Nazi Germany in 1945, is a fascist imperialist regime that can and must be defeated. Fascism was defeated last time because a coalition held firm and applied its superior economic power. The same holds true now.",

(Its win in that instance was part of a larger coalition and with decisive American economic assistance.) Soviet forces were in trouble in Afghanistan immediately after their 1979 invasion and had to withdraw a decade later.\n\nAnd the Russian army of today is not the Red Army. Russia is not the USSR. Soviet Ukraine was a source of resources and soldiers for the Red Army. In that victory of 1945, Ukrainian soldiers in the Red Army took huge losses \u2014 greater than American, British and French losses combined. It was disproportionately Ukrainians who fought their war to Berlin in the uniform of the Red Army.\n\nToday, Russia is fighting not together with Ukraine but against Ukraine. It is fighting a war of aggression on the territory of another state. And it lacks the American economic support \u2014 Lend-Lease \u2014 that the Red Army needed to defeat Nazi Germany. In this constellation, there is no particular reason to expect Russia to win. One would expect, instead, that Russia\u2019s only chance is to prevent the West from helping Ukraine \u2014 by persuading us that its victory is inevitable, so that we don\u2019t apply our decisive economic power.\n\nThe last six months bear this out: Russia\u2019s minor battlefield victories came at a time when the United States was delaying Ukraine aid, rather than supplying it.\n\nToday\u2019s Russia is a new state. It has existed since 1991. Like Brezhnev before him, Russian President Vladimir Putin rules through nostalgia. He refers to the Soviet and also the Russian imperial past. But the Russian Empire also lost wars. It lost the Crimean War in 1856. It lost the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It lost the First World War in 1917. In none of those three cases was Russia able to keep forces in the field for more than about three years.\n\nIn the United States there is great nervousness about a Russian defeat. If something seems impossible, we cannot imagine what could happen next. And so there is a tendency, even among supporters of Ukraine, to think that the best resolution is a tie.\n\nSuch thinking is unrealistic. And it reveals, behind the nerves, a strange American conceit.\n\nNo one can guide a war in such a way. And nothing in our prior attempts to influence Russia suggests that we can exercise that kind of influence. Russia and Ukraine are both fighting to win. The questions are: who will win, and with what consequences?\n\nIf Russia wins, the consequences are horrifying: a risk of a larger war in Europe, more likelihood of a Chinese adventure in the Pacific, the weakening of international legal order generally, the likely spread of nuclear weapons, the loss of faith in democracy.\n\nSoviet soldiers during a patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan, April 25, 1988.

And, in general, this led Russians to reflect and reform. Defeat in Crimea forced an autocracy to end serfdom. Russia\u2019s loss to Japan led to an experiment with elections. The Soviet failure in Afghanistan led to Gorbachev\u2019s reforms and thus the end of the cold war.\n\nBeneath the Russian particularities, history offers a more general and still more reassuring lesson about empires. Russia is fighting today an imperial war. It denies the existence of the Ukrainian state and nation, and it carries out atrocities that recall the worst of the European imperial past.\n\nThe peaceful Europe of today consists of powers that lost their last imperial wars and then chose democracy. It is not only possible to lose your last imperial war: it is also good, not only for the world, but for you.\n\nRussia can lose this war, and should, for the sake of Russians themselves. A defeated Russia means not only the end of senseless losses of young life in Ukraine. It is also Russia\u2019s one chance to become a post-imperial country, one where reform is possible, one where Russians themselves might be protected by law and able to cast meaningful votes.\n\nDefeat in Ukraine is Russia\u2019s historical chance for normality \u2014 as Russians who want democracy and the rule of law will say.\n\nLike the United States and Europe, Ukraine celebrates the victory of 1945 on May 8th rather than May 9th. Ukrainians have every right to remember and interpret that victory: they suffered more than Russians from German occupation and died in huge numbers on the battlefield.\n\nAnd Ukrainians are right to think that Russia today, like Nazi Germany in 1945, is a fascist imperialist regime that can and must be defeated. Fascism was defeated last time because a coalition held firm and applied its superior economic power. The same holds true now.",

        "content": "During these May days, when we remember our common victory - the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, we would like to recall the words of the Belarusian president: \u201cThe more time passes from the heroic and tragic events, the more we venerate the sacrificial feat of our grandfathers and great grandfathers, those, who saved the mankind from enslavement and extermination.\u201d But let's figure out why the more time passes, the stronger is our desire to stand up for truth and justice, and the more fiercely the West holds onto global dominance. Why the farther we are from those events, the more careful we are of our historical memory and the more barbaric our neighbors are towards war monuments. The war crimes have no statute of limitations, do they? We discuss this in a new episode of BelTA\u2019s Youtube project \u201cAfter the Fact: Lukashenko\u2019s Decisions\u201d.\n\nWhat was the war for Belarusians?\n\nSome chided Belarus for its over-focus on the war commemoration as if no important events happened ever since. To be honest, until recently, some of us teased the older generation over their \"anything but war\" mantra and the traditional wishes for a peaceful sky. It turned out that it was a mistake. Big mistake.\n\nThe great Russian commander Alexander Suvorov is credited with the following words: \u201cThe war is not over until the last soldier is buried!\" He is believed to have said them after the defeat of the Turkish army at the Battle of Rymnik. Russia lost a couple of hundred people in that battle\u2026\n\nNow let's get back to our history. In April 2021, the General Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal case into the genocide of the population of Belarus during the Great Patriotic War and the post-war period. the German invaders and their accomplices killed more than three million Belarusians. Almost 400,000 people were taken to Germany for slave labor. More than 12,000 villages were completely or partially destroyed. Several hundred of them shared the sad fate of Khatyn. More than 580 death camps were established on the territory of our country, and almost 200 major punitive operations were carried out. \"The investigation of the criminal case into the genocide of the Belarusian people continues. For a little more than three years of the investigation, we obtained the information confirming that the scale of the tragedy during the Great Patriotic War is much greater than previously thought. One of the goals of the investigation is to establish all the facts of the genocide that took place on the territory of our country during the Great Patriotic War. But the most important goal is to bring to justice all Nazi criminals who committed atrocities against the Belarusian people. We are moving towards this goal. As part of the criminal case we have put together a list of henchmen and their accomplices that will soon be persecuted by the Prosecutor General of Belarus,\u201d said Sergei Shikunets, Deputy Head of the Department for Supervision over the Investigation of Particularly Important Criminal Cases of the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\nIf we apply Suvorov's words to our realities, will the war ever end for Belarusians?\n\nThis is why the memory of those who died in the fight for the freedom and independence of our Motherland, for the liberation of the planet from Nazism, the memory of the victims of Nazism is sacred for our people. This has become part of the national idea.\n\n\u201cRecently we hear more people say: \u2018What do we need this for. Let us forget everything\u2019. A hideous thing hides behind these seemingly harmless words. It is an attempt not only to forget but also rewrite the history of the war, take away the feat of our people. We must not forget it. We must not give Great Victory away. It is a testimony of the greatness of the Soviet people whose descendants we are,\u201d Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said at a ceremony to unveil the Trostenets Memorial in 2015.\n\nApproaches by Belarus and its neighbors to honoring the past\n\nLet's compare. In 2020, the Ola memorial was opened in Svetlogorsk District on the site of the village destroyed during the war. Almost 2,000 people were burned here, more than half of them were children. That's twelve Khatyns! In the same year, a monument to the burned villages was dedicated in Mogilev Oblast.\n\nTwo years ago, the Khatyn memorial complex was declared an all-Belarusian construction site. Student teams from all over Belarus worked here. The project was financed from the budget and also with the money earned during the national cleanup day. All in all, about Br5 million was spent on the renovation of the memorial. Roughly speaking, it was $1.5-2 million. In 2023, more than 500,000 people visited Khatyn, which was almost twice as many as in previous years. Such a flow of tourists was associated with the opening of a unique museum here.\n\nAt the same time, Latvia was busy too: the Riga City Council proposed to demolish the monument to the Liberators of Riga. This idea was supported by the president of the country. The city authorities bulldozed the flowers laid at the memorial, opened criminal and administrative cases against the protesters, promised to expel from the country all foreigners who joined the protesters... It came to the point of absurd: they decided to drain the pond near the monument and feed the fish to animals in Riga Zoo. The dismantling of the memorial in honor of Soviet soldiers cost \u20ac2 million. It turned out that this was just the beginning: the Latvian government had prepared a list of 69 Soviet war memorials to be demolished.\n\nLatvia\u2019s actions were not unique for Europe. Poland has been implementing its decommunization law since 2017. The dismantling of Soviet monuments and memorials in honor of the liberators has become almost a national idea in Estonia and Lithuania. Ukraine has eagerly joined this dance on the bones.\n\nIt became almost a matter of honor for Kiev to replace the Soviet emblem on Europe\u2019s highest monument with the Ukrainian trident coat of arms. The project to \u2018decommunize\u2019 the Ukrainian Motherland monument cost about $500,000. This is not about money (although it could have been used to address more pressing problems in Ukraine). The question is whether such \u201crebranding\u201d made Ukraine greater. After all Kiev, Minsk, Moscow, and other capitals of the post-Soviet republics survived thanks to those whom these monuments commemorate!\n\n\u201cToday you and I wonder about the same thing: could the heroes of the war have imagined that 80 years later their children and grandchildren would have to fight for the truth about the Great Victory, for the right to honor the victorious warriors on this holy day? Today we should openly speak about the fact that during the Great Patriotic War Belarusian civilian population was subjected to a massive and systemic extermination. We will never forget that millions of our compatriots fell on battlefields, perished in death camps, were hanged, shot or tortured to death by gestapo. We remember it and if someone forgets it, we will remind them,\u201d the Belarusian president said in 2021.\n\nWhom does the memory of the victims and heroes of the war give hard time today?\n\n\u201cThe memory of the victims of the war, the heroism of our fathers and grandfathers gives a hard time to some people, first of all, to the ideological followers of murderers and traitors. It is they who honor the executioners in their parliaments today. It was they who started the war against graves and monuments in Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine. Complete madmen! Do they think that by destroying a monument they will destroy the memory that lives in the hearts of the people? The people who found the strength to build new peaceful relations with those states that only yesterday brought suffering and death to our lands,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko said as he attended a ceremony together with Russian President Vladimir Putin to unveil the memorial to the USSR civilians who fell victim of Nazi genocide during Great Patriotic War in January 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this great monument bear importance for our peoples? After all, there are thousands of war monuments in Russia and Belarus. Everything is simple. The overwhelming majority of them honor the heroes - Red Army soldiers and partisans, the people who defended their land with weapons in their hands. It is as important to pay tribute to the people who could not defend themselves.\n\n\u201cThe Prosecutor General's Office of Belarus nominated Brest Fortress for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List as a memorial symbolizing the fight against Nazism, the fight against the policy of genocide throughout the world. The Prosecutor General's Office also suggested awarding the international status of historical and cultural heritage to the Trostenets concentration camp, which was the largest one in terms of the number of people killed there. Large-scale work is conducted to set up expositions dedicated to the genocide of the Belarusian people in all corners of our country. Together with the Education Ministry we have prepared supplements about the genocide of the Belarusian people to the history textbooks,\u201d representative of the General Prosecutor's Office Sergei Shikunets said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war\u201d\n\nAgain we may ask a rhetorical question: why our European neighbors are deeply preoccupied with demolishing Soviet memorials? Why do Belarus and Russia try their best to perpetuate the memory of that terrible tragedy? A common tragedy for all our peoples.\n\nDuring that ceremony Aleksandr Lukashenko reminded us of a simple truth: we cannot change the past, but it is in our power to protect the future. For this, we should cherish our common historical memory, the brotherhood of peoples and the unbreakable unity of the nations that fought against the world evil and defeated it. At a time when some forces prefer to forget the terrible pages of the Second World War, try to shift the accents in terms of responsibility of some countries, Belarus stands guards of the true history. Not only in stone. Back in October 2004 Aleksandr Lukashenko signed a decree to establish a new insignia - a pennant \u2018For valor and perseverance during the Great Patriotic War\u2019. It was awarded to 36 settlements of Belarus. Each of these places became a true citadel of fortitude, where both soldiers and local residents showed incredible bravery.\n\n\u201cAs long as we build monuments, as long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war, we will avoid such terrible tragedies. As soon as we forget the way to these holy places, a war will certainly follow,\u201d the Belarusian leader warned.\n\nIs it possible to forgive the Nazis\u2019 crimes?\n\nThanks to search operations, many horrifying facts have been uncovered and new evidence of terrible crimes has been discovered over the past three years.\n\n\u201cThe German fascist invaders and their accomplices spared no one: either children, or the elderly, or women. In this exhibit we see fragments of shoes found at the excavation site in Ivanovshchina Forest in Logoisk District, Minsk Oblast. In that pit of about 80 meters in diameter we found bone remains belonging to at least 1,021 people. The most horrifying thing is that we found skeletal remains of children and women. We had to remove the bone remains with our own hands. It was really hard to do this emotionally because we understood we were touching history. It was hard to imagine what happened in that place 80 years ago: people waiting for their death near the pit. People were brought to the edge of the pit, forced to their knees and shot dead. Those who were wounded were simply buried alive,\u201d Sergei Shikunets said.\n\nThousands of concentration camp prisoners have shared their memories. Their stories leave no one indifferent. We would like to tell you about the fate of one girl - Emilia Kopytok. She, a 10-year-old red-haired girl then, called Squirrel by her loving parents, went through six concentration camps. And she survived! The child saw baths with human fat from which soap was made, saw little children and their mothers brutally murdered. Is it possible to forgive such things? Is it possible to forget?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we were allowed to get off carriages, I saw a forest, German guards and German shepherd dogs. And a huge bonfire. Nearby there was another train full of Jews. The Jews were also getting off train, and mothers were carrying small children in their arms. They were all very pretty and curly-haired. These children were grabbed and thrown into the bonfire. The mothers who ran after their children screaming were bayoneted and thrown into the fire too. There was terrible screaming, terrible howling, terrible crying, terrible barking of dogs. The bonfire was burning like a candle,\u201d Emilia Kopytok said.\n\nBelarusians are a strong nation. Strong because they never forget. Strong because they are ready to forgive. But is it really a time to forgive?",

        "content": "During these May days, when we remember our common victory - the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, we would like to recall the words of the Belarusian president: \u201cThe more time passes from the heroic and tragic events, the more we venerate the sacrificial feat of our grandfathers and great grandfathers, those, who saved the mankind from enslavement and extermination.\u201d But let's figure out why the more time passes, the stronger is our desire to stand up for truth and justice, and the more fiercely the West holds onto global dominance. Why the farther we are from those events, the more careful we are of our historical memory and the more barbaric our neighbors are towards war monuments. The war crimes have no statute of limitations, do they? We discuss this in a new episode of BelTA\u2019s Youtube project \u201cAfter the Fact: Lukashenko\u2019s Decisions\u201d.\n\nWhat was the war for Belarusians?\n\nSome chided Belarus for its over-focus on the war commemoration as if no important events happened ever since. To be honest, until recently, some of us teased the older generation over their \"anything but war\" mantra and the traditional wishes for a peaceful sky. It turned out that it was a mistake. Big mistake.\n\nThe great Russian commander Alexander Suvorov is credited with the following words: \u201cThe war is not over until the last soldier is buried!\" He is believed to have said them after the defeat of the Turkish army at the Battle of Rymnik. Russia lost a couple of hundred people in that battle\u2026\n\nNow let's get back to our history. In April 2021, the General Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal case into the genocide of the population of Belarus during the Great Patriotic War and the post-war period. the German invaders and their accomplices killed more than three million Belarusians. Almost 400,000 people were taken to Germany for slave labor. More than 12,000 villages were completely or partially destroyed. Several hundred of them shared the sad fate of Khatyn. More than 580 death camps were established on the territory of our country, and almost 200 major punitive operations were carried out. \"The investigation of the criminal case into the genocide of the Belarusian people continues. For a little more than three years of the investigation, we obtained the information confirming that the scale of the tragedy during the Great Patriotic War is much greater than previously thought. One of the goals of the investigation is to establish all the facts of the genocide that took place on the territory of our country during the Great Patriotic War. But the most important goal is to bring to justice all Nazi criminals who committed atrocities against the Belarusian people. We are moving towards this goal. As part of the criminal case we have put together a list of henchmen and their accomplices that will soon be persecuted by the Prosecutor General of Belarus,\u201d said Sergei Shikunets, Deputy Head of the Department for Supervision over the Investigation of Particularly Important Criminal Cases of the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\nIf we apply Suvorov's words to our realities, will the war ever end for Belarusians?\n\nThis is why the memory of those who died in the fight for the freedom and independence of our Motherland, for the liberation of the planet from Nazism, the memory of the victims of Nazism is sacred for our people. This has become part of the national idea.\n\n\u201cRecently we hear more people say: \u2018What do we need this for. Let us forget everything\u2019. A hideous thing hides behind these seemingly harmless words. It is an attempt not only to forget but also rewrite the history of the war, take away the feat of our people. We must not forget it. We must not give Great Victory away. It is a testimony of the greatness of the Soviet people whose descendants we are,\u201d Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said at a ceremony to unveil the Trostenets Memorial in 2015.\n\nApproaches by Belarus and its neighbors to honoring the past\n\nLet's compare. In 2020, the Ola memorial was opened in Svetlogorsk District on the site of the village destroyed during the war. Almost 2,000 people were burned here, more than half of them were children. That's twelve Khatyns! In the same year, a monument to the burned villages was dedicated in Mogilev Oblast.\n\nTwo years ago, the Khatyn memorial complex was declared an all-Belarusian construction site. Student teams from all over Belarus worked here. The project was financed from the budget and also with the money earned during the national cleanup day. All in all, about Br5 million was spent on the renovation of the memorial. Roughly speaking, it was $1.5-2 million. In 2023, more than 500,000 people visited Khatyn, which was almost twice as many as in previous years. Such a flow of tourists was associated with the opening of a unique museum here.\n\nAt the same time, Latvia was busy too: the Riga City Council proposed to demolish the monument to the Liberators of Riga. This idea was supported by the president of the country. The city authorities bulldozed the flowers laid at the memorial, opened criminal and administrative cases against the protesters, promised to expel from the country all foreigners who joined the protesters... It came to the point of absurd: they decided to drain the pond near the monument and feed the fish to animals in Riga Zoo. The dismantling of the memorial in honor of Soviet soldiers cost \u20ac2 million. It turned out that this was just the beginning: the Latvian government had prepared a list of 69 Soviet war memorials to be demolished.\n\nLatvia\u2019s actions were not unique for Europe. Poland has been implementing its decommunization law since 2017. The dismantling of Soviet monuments and memorials in honor of the liberators has become almost a national idea in Estonia and Lithuania. Ukraine has eagerly joined this dance on the bones.\n\nIt became almost a matter of honor for Kiev to replace the Soviet emblem on Europe\u2019s highest monument with the Ukrainian trident coat of arms. The project to \u2018decommunize\u2019 the Ukrainian Motherland monument cost about $500,000. This is not about money (although it could have been used to address more pressing problems in Ukraine). The question is whether such \u201crebranding\u201d made Ukraine greater. After all Kiev, Minsk, Moscow, and other capitals of the post-Soviet republics survived thanks to those whom these monuments commemorate!\n\n\u201cToday you and I wonder about the same thing: could the heroes of the war have imagined that 80 years later their children and grandchildren would have to fight for the truth about the Great Victory, for the right to honor the victorious warriors on this holy day? Today we should openly speak about the fact that during the Great Patriotic War Belarusian civilian population was subjected to a massive and systemic extermination. We will never forget that millions of our compatriots fell on battlefields, perished in death camps, were hanged, shot or tortured to death by gestapo. We remember it and if someone forgets it, we will remind them,\u201d the Belarusian president said in 2021.\n\nWhom does the memory of the victims and heroes of the war give hard time today?\n\n\u201cThe memory of the victims of the war, the heroism of our fathers and grandfathers gives a hard time to some people, first of all, to the ideological followers of murderers and traitors. It is they who honor the executioners in their parliaments today. It was they who started the war against graves and monuments in Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine. Complete madmen!

Although it was after the Second World War that we managed to wrest from each other this commitment to never fight again, effectively putting an end to the killing of millions that had been going on for centuries in Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe Austrian chancellor stressed that everyone must be vigilant when someone is trying to pass off a criminal as victim in Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\n\"We must be vigilant when we think and talk about defensive democracy and defense, so as not to allow the criminal to become a victim as radicals sometimes try to do as regards Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" Nehammer emphasized.\n\nAccording to the chancellor, it is also necessary to be vigilant in the matter of a terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. In this context, he noted that the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could end with the capitulation of Hamas \u2013 and this should be a \"clear demand from the West.\"\n\nAs Ukrinform reported, the right-wing populist Austrian Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), known for its pro-Russian position, used an anti-Ukrainian poster in its campaign for the European Parliament elections.\n\nRead also: Ukrainian diplomats and community commemorate victims of Mauthausen camp in Austria\n\nIn this regard, the Embassy of Ukraine sent an official note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Austria, condemning the strategy of the FP\u00d6 to manipulatively and distortedly portray the reasons and essence of Russia's full-scale aggression, \"which, among other things, is an insult to the Ukrainian people that creates grounds for justifying Russia\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine\".\n\nPhoto: President\u2019s Office",

        "content": "Federal Chancellor of Austria, Karl Nehammer, says it is unacceptable to allow replacing the concepts of criminal and victim in the war of aggression Russia is waging against Ukraine.\n\nThe head of the Austrian government said this during a solemn event in Vienna on the occasion of liberation from National Socialism and the end of the Second World War, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.\n\n\"Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is causing so much suffering, it has brought the injustice of war back to European soil. Although it was after the Second World War that we managed to wrest from each other this commitment to never fight again, effectively putting an end to the killing of millions that had been going on for centuries in Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe Austrian chancellor stressed that everyone must be vigilant when someone is trying to pass off a criminal as victim in Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\n\"We must be vigilant when we think and talk about defensive democracy and defense, so as not to allow the criminal to become a victim as radicals sometimes try to do as regards Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" Nehammer emphasized.\n\nAccording to the chancellor, it is also necessary to be vigilant in the matter of a terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. In this context, he noted that the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could end with the capitulation of Hamas \u2013 and this should be a \"clear demand from the West.\"\n\nAs Ukrinform reported, the right-wing populist Austrian Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), known for its pro-Russian position, used an anti-Ukrainian poster in its campaign for the European Parliament elections.\n\nRead also: Ukrainian diplomats and community commemorate victims of Mauthausen camp in Austria\n\nIn this regard, the Embassy of Ukraine sent an official note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Austria, condemning the strategy of the FP\u00d6 to manipulatively and distortedly portray the reasons and essence of Russia's full-scale aggression, \"which, among other things, is an insult to the Ukrainian people that creates grounds for justifying Russia\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine\".\n\nPhoto: President\u2019s Office",

        "content": "Every year on May 9, Vladimir Putin delivers an address to celebrate Victory Day, which marks the Soviet Union\u2019s triumph over Nazi Germany in World War II, a war Russians dub the \u201cGreat Patriotic War.\u201d If history is any guide, Putin will again use this year\u2019s speech to justify his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. For Putin, it is an opportunity to project to his people an image of Russia as a powerful nation defeating fascism, and abroad to project Russia as a great power.\n\nModern Russian schools\u2019 history classes conveniently leave out the fact that the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact set the stage for the war. The secret agreement allowed Germany and the Soviet Union to invade Poland and divide it between them, while Moscow took control of the independent Baltic countries, thus sparking World War II. Instead, Russians have always claimed that the war began in 1941, with Nazi Germany\u2019s invasion of the USSR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nationalistic narratives, called \u201chistory\u201d in Putin\u2019s Russia, promote the idea that the Soviet Union, acting as a \u201cglobal savior\u201d from Nazism, lost over 27 million citizens in the Second World War. This spilt blood, the Kremlin argues, makes Russia exceptional and secures its perpetual role as the global watchdog preventing \u201cflare-ups\u201d of \u201cNazism\u201d \u2013 something that Putin has often cited as a reason for his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLast year\u2019s Victory Day parade featured just a single World War II-era tank, a T-34. This year, Putin plans to feature larger elements of Russia\u2019s military arsenal. However, it is not all about hard power rolling across Red Square; it is also a propaganda-intense event to mislead the Russian public about why Ukraine has been invaded, which has caused over 475,000 Russian casualties. Kyiv warned that the Kremlin would intensify attacks on Ukraine before Victory Day to strengthen its propaganda machine glorifying patriotism and exciting the public about the wholly unnecessary war in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther Topics of Interest Gazprom Has to Offload Property to Compensate for Historically High Losses The Russian state-owned energy company has posted its biggest losses in a quarter of a century after gas sales more than halved with the loss of its European markets because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nPutin has called Victory Day a \u201csacred holiday\u201d and Dmitry Mezentsev, General Secretary of the Union State, expressed the hope that history will erase the reasons for the emergence of Nazism, which Russia is now fighting, something that Russia will try to impart on the five Central Asian presidents who plan to attend Thursday\u2019s propaganda bonanza.\n\nVirtually every Russian town has multiple World War II monuments proclaiming the victory of communism over fascism \u2013 an argument that by now is dated. So, for the Kremlin\u2019s contemporary propaganda needs, Putin has become centered on fanning fears that a sudden uptick in \u201cfascism\u201d abroad would be the catalyst for Russia to save the world yet again by racking up massive casualties.\n\nMoscow cannot get enough of convincing people that the world is safer because of Russia. This myth, built on historical revisionism, was repeated by Putin during his interview with Tucker Carlson, in which he claimed that Poland had collaborated with the Nazis \u2013 leaving out his own country\u2019s nefarious role in the affair.\n\nThe increasing number of Stalin statues going up in Russian towns is a strong indication that the population is not giving flippant responses in polls, as now 56 percent of Russians regard Josef Stalin as a \u201cgreat leader\u201d and support for Stalin has grown the most among young people. Information operations to combat this trend should focus on how Stalin was personally present during the signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo keep the world safe from the threat of Russia\u2019s promises to \u201cguarantee security\u201d across the globe and to wean Russian citizens from their state\u2019s rabid propaganda, the US should launch an offensive information-operations campaign and disseminate the facts about World War II: Russia played a significant role. Not only did Moscow cause the world\u2019s worst armed conflict, but it also continues to perpetuate similar atrocities today.\n\nOnly when the world recognizes that Russia\u2019s efforts for \u201cglobal peace\u201d are a threat and that the world is better off without Putin, can we truly celebrate the global defeat of fascism.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are those of the authors and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.",

        "content": "Since the beginning of the New Year, Russia has embarked on a massive onslaught targeting Ukrainian cities on a par with its bombing blitz at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. This offensive assault was not surprising as Russia was believed to be purposely accumulating missiles and drones in the final several months of 2023. However, the source of some of the missiles used in Russia\u2019s most recent bombing missions has touched off some serious consternation in Ukraine and in Western capitals.\n\nIn reaction to these latest barrages of bombs, the White House claimed that Russia had used North Korean ballistic missiles to strike Ukraine. This announcement was later verified by senior Ukrainian officials. On Jan. 9, 2024, the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, the European Union and some 40 additional partner countries denounced North Korea\u2019s export of ballistic missiles for Russian use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transport of North Korean missiles is the latest expansion of the country\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s military aggression toward Ukraine. The first reports of North Korean arms shipments to Russia came out back in late 2022. A year later, in October 2023, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby revealed that North Korea had delivered over 1,000 canisters of weaponry and equipment to Russia. In late 2023, South Korean officials maintained North Korean military factories were operating at full force in an attempt to meet Russian demand for arms.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Russia Leadership Shakeup The new MinDef Belousov, is a technocrat without Defense experience, but nevertheless a competent and trusted manager, the author writes.\n\nIt is not known what Russia is trading in exchange for North Korean weapons, although rumors claim the Kremlin is providing the sanctioned nation with access to newly developed military technologies. It has been reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited several military sites displaying advanced military systems during a September 2023 trip to Russia.\n\nUnfortunately, North Korea has been joined in stocking Vladimir Putin with an arsenal for attacking Ukraine by a second autocratic regime. Iran has furnished Russia with vast numbers of attack drones and artillery shells with Russia also gaining use of Iran\u2019s drone technologies to institute extensive domestic production of attack drones to utilize against Ukraine. Reports in the New Year show this collaboration is strengthening with Russia set to receive upgraded drones along with Iranian ballistic missiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian war effort two years into its invasion of Ukraine has come to be dependent on the military backing it is getting from North Korea and Iran. Whereas Putin has transferred much of Russia\u2019s economy into war mode, the duration and vigor of the fighting in Ukraine demonstrates that Moscow is presently not able to meet the high demand for specific munitions classes like drones, missiles and artillery shells.\n\nCurrently in year three of the full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, North Korea and Iran\u2019s ammunition deliveries are allowing Russia to preserve a notable heavy weapons advantage in a battle now described as a war of attrition. Additionally, the constant supply of Iranian drones allows Russia to pursue its intense bombing crusade against Ukrainian cities and the country\u2019s civilian infrastructure. Ballistic missiles obtained from North Korea and Iran will permit Russia to continue expanding the air war against Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Putin\u2019s fellow cohorts in Pyongyang and Tehran become braver in their willingness to subsidize Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, the West\u2019s group allegiance to the Ukrainian side has become questionable. In the US, the recently passed aid package for Ukraine saw a six-month delay thanks to domestic political haggling. This development is raising questions about the future of the West\u2019s support for Ukraine in a drawn-out conflict with Russia.\n\nRecent indicators of Western frailty are encouraging to Putin, who believes he can withstand Ukraine\u2019s Western allies in a test of political fortitude. His historical endgame of invading Ukraine has always been a venture to put an end to Western dominance and initiate a new world order. Forming alliances with congenial autocratic regimes is a major step toward achieving such a goal.\n\nThere is little doubt that Russia has successfully instituted a partnership in arms together with North Korea and Iran. The three autocratic countries are capitalizing on their military capability and manufacturing large quantities of weapons required to thwart resistance from the West and attain a Russian victory in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis union of authoritarians constitutes a severe threat to the future of the world\u2019s security. Should Russia triumph in Ukraine with the help of military backing from North Korea and Iran, Ukrainians will not be the only victims. A Putin victory could set off a catastrophic paradigm. The global community could easily be confronted by more wars of aggression, with the world plunging into a perilous new age where today\u2019s regulations with regard to national sovereignty and territorial integrity would no longer be applicable.\n\nThis is not yet a reality, but time is of the essence. To avoid decades of international apprehension and uncertainty, Western leaders have to send an unequivocal message to all autocrats and Putin copycats by ensuring Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine culminates in a momentous defeat.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are the author\u2019s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.",

        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nOn Tuesday, Vladimir Putin was inaugurated for another six-year term as president amid the worst crisis in Moscow\u2019s relations with the West over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. During the traditionally ornate ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin called his compatriots a \"united and great nation\" and vowed to place Russia\u2019s interests and security above anything else. Brimming with confidence, the Russian strongman punctuated his speech by declaring: \"Together we will overcome all obstacles. We will fulfill everything we have planned. Together we will win.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the top U.S. spy chief, DNI Avril Haines, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the Russia-Ukraine war is \"unlikely to end anytime soon,\" warning that Putin\u2019s \"aggressive tactics are likely to continue.\" That, despite the fact that Congress recently approved another multibillion-dollar military aid package for Ukraine to help it fight the Russians.\n\nWhat is inside Putin\u2019s mind at this time? Will the Russian dictator be deterred by our government\u2019s unwavering commitment to fund Kyiv? What are his next steps?\n\nAS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN SOVIET RUSSIA, DON'T LET AMERICA TURN INTO A GODLESS NATION\n\nHaving examined Russia\u2019s force posture, the state of the Russian military and economy, declared strategic goals and threat perceptions, here is what we can expect from Putin, whose thinking I\u2019ve studied and analyzed in the course of my intelligence career. I will also note what Putin will probably not do.\n\nFirst, the Russian forces will highly likely initiate a major counteroffensive campaign in northeastern Ukraine. It's possible that it could begin right after the Victory Day Parade, the national holiday celebrating Russia\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Aiming to capitalize on Ukraine\u2019s shortages in manpower, combat hardware and ammunition, the Russians will seek to break through the front lines by or during this summer.\n\nTo make this happen, Moscow is preparing 100,000 troops to join the front lines, consistent with the decree signed by Putin in December directing the Ministry of Defense to increase the armed forces by 170,000 additional personnel to the maximum strength of 1,320,000 servicemen. Moscow is also increasing its defense spending by almost 70% in 2024 from 2023.\n\nPutin feels that the momentum is on Russia\u2019s side theater wide, as Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned. This being said, he is almost certainly deeply concerned about a recent statement made by French President Emmanuel Macron to The Economist. Macron insinuated that he would send troops to Ukraine \"if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request.\"\n\nAiming to deter NATO from deploying forces into the theater, Russia will hold military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons. Putin personally ordered the drills to \"practice for the preparation and deployment for use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" according to Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense.\n\nWhile Russia routinely conducts strategic nuclear exercises, announcing them in advance, the public declaration made by Moscow of non-strategic nuclear drills is unprecedented. It is intended as a strategic signaling to leaders in Washington and NATO commanders to stay out of what Russia considers its strategic security perimeter, of which Ukraine is part in Moscow\u2019s view.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s inauguration speech, Putin \u2013 almost certainly referring to Ukrainians living in the regions annexed by Moscow \u2013 thanked the \"citizens of Russia in all regions of our country, residents of our historical lands who defended the right to be together with the Motherland.\" Putin believes that Russia has a rightful claim to Ukraine its statehood originated from \"Kievan Rus,\" the land that is currently occupied by modern Ukraine.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of Russians support the actions of its military in Ukraine, effectively agreeing with Putin, according to the Levada Center. The same percentage of Russians believe that Russia will win the war. Levada is an independent polling agency designated by the Russian state as a \"foreign agent\" for expressing views that are unfavorable to the Russian government.\n\nIS RUSSIA\u2019S PUTIN A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN OR HAS HE WEAPONIZED RELIGION TO ADVANCE HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS?\n\nSecond, Russian intelligence services will likely ramp up their hunt for Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an attempt to assassinate him. On Saturday, the Russian government added Zelenskyy to the list of wanted criminals. The Russian Interior Ministry justified the search warrant for the Ukrainian president by stating that is \"under an article of the criminal code.\"\n\nZelenskyy has been on the target list since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022 and has survived multiple assassination attempts. A day before Putin\u2019s inauguration, Ukraine\u2019s counterintelligence services reportedly disrupted a Russian covert operation aimed at infiltrating Zelenskyy\u2019s security team and taking him hostage or killing him.\n\nRussia has a targeted assassination program governed by the federal law, \"On Countering Extreme Activity,\" that was approved by Putin in 2002, two-and-a-half years after he assumed the presidency, and updated in 2006. This law already allows Russian intelligence services to \"eliminate (likvidirovat) Zelenskyy and other military and political leaders of Ukraine as \u2018persons presenting a threat to the Russian state.\u2019\"\n\nPlacing Zelenskyy on the \"wanted list\" sends a signal to Russian security services that capturing or killing him is a priority for the Kremlin.\n\nThe Russians will likely intensify their efforts to eliminate Zelenskyy on or after May 20, the day when his presidential term officially ends. Last November, Zelenskyy canceled the 2024 presidential election, arguing that Ukraine must concentrate all its resources on fighting Russia, which prompted Moscow to consider him illegitimate as the leader of Ukraine.\n\nThird, Russia will intensify its non-kinetic confrontation with Washington. While Russia fears a direct war with the U.S. and NATO, because of our superiority in conventional arms, it views the risk of the erosion of its strategic buffer zone, on which it relied for its security for centuries, even more. Washington\u2019s continuous support provided to Ukraine has exacerbated Russia\u2019s fears of a future conflict with NATO.\n\nMoscow believes a direct kinetic U.S.-Russia war is \"inevitable\" in the long run. The Russian General Staff made this intelligence assessment based on the long-standing U.S. policy seeking to democratize Russia\u2019s post-Soviet neighbors in Eurasia and Washington\u2019s stated intentions to accept Ukraine into NATO, an adversarial alliance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLast week, four Russian military aircraft breached the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), but didn\u2019t enter U.S. airspace, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Russia periodically flies strategic bombers close to our borders. These practice runs are intended to test our responses and to signal the readiness of the Russian military for a full-on war with the United States over control of the post-Soviet regions. Russian weapons systems are already capable of striking targets throughout the United States and Canada from stand-off distances \u2013 that is, without entering U.S. sovereign airspace to deliver the weapons.\n\nRussian intelligence services also will likely intensify their efforts to arrest U.S. citizens traveling to Russia in a effort to rattle the Biden administration and to accumulate a list of candidates to trade with Washington for high-value Russian operatives held in U.S. prisons. On Tuesday, a U.S. Army soldier was detained in Vladivostok on charges of theft. Having had a number of prisoner swaps that Putin almost certainly feels were favorable to Russia, Moscow likely concluded that it can manipulate the Biden administration into giving up Russian assets valuable to Putin.\n\nFinally, what Putin will not do is invade a NATO nation. Despite such claims made by Washington politicians, such a move would be suicidal for Putin as it would trigger NATO Article 5 Collective Defense. Putin is acutely aware of Russia\u2019s conventional inferiority visa-a-vis NATO.\n\nPutin routinely uses Russia\u2019s nuclear trump card to intimidate the West and would likely authorize a tactical nuclear strike in the theater such as in Ukraine in certain scenarios, but those are high on the escalation ladder. But, as a rational actor, he would not intentionally pick a fight in which Russia would face the might of NATO\u2019s entire war-fighting machine. Such a claim is illogical. It is also refuted by multiple assessments made by the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe 2024 Annual Threat assessment reveals that \"Russia almost certainly does not want a direct military conflict with U.S. and NATO forces and will continue asymmetric activity below what it calculates to be the threshold of military conflict globally.\"\n\nThe following excerpts from unclassified intelligence reports debunk the idea that Russia has the military and economic capacity to invade a NATO country, triggering a war with NATO: \"Russia has suffered more military losses than at any time since World War II \u2013 roughly 300,000 casualties and thousands of tanks and armored combat vehicles\" and \"Moscow's military forces will face a multi-year recovery after suffering extensive equipment and personnel losses during the Ukraine conflict.\"\n\nThe same report reveals that \"the Russian military has and will continue to face issues of attrition, personnel shortages, and morale challenges.\"",
