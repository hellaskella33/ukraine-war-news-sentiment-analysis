This is not just our challenge. This is a global trend, in fact, a technology of global expansion. Sanctions are a traditional practice of the world monopolist: the United States and its ally the European Union. This is how they have always tried to settle score with competitors. Today they are working against China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, and now Belarus. Today, they have imposed sanctions against half the world. Attacking us, they are trying to squeeze our industry flagship companies out of the market,\" Aleksandr Lukashenko said.\n\nHe stressed that sanctions are an element of hybrid war. \"In fact, they are working according to the algorithm: sanctions - internal rebellion - military invasion,\" the head of state noted.\n\nThe Belarusian leader also mentioned the now trendy term \"smart sanctions\". \"Allegedly, their impact is selective \u2013 only on the authorities. In fact, the West is looking for, methodically and cynically, for the pain points of the economy, conducting truly inhumane experiments. Ultimately, people suffer,\" Aleksandr Lukashenko stressed.\n\n\"We resolutely condemn sanctions. Sanctions are the inquisition of our time, a blatant violation of international law. The corresponding position is enshrined in the ruling of the Belarusian Constitutional Court, and we will proceed from this. The so-called compatriots who call for sanctions commit a crime against the state and their own people. They will be held responsible for this according to the law, wherever they are,\" the head of state said.",

        "content": "How imminent is the threat of a full-scale war on the Ukrainian border? It's the question on many minds. While diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis are ramping up, the Russian troop buildup also continues, according to the Pentagon.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's position is that the threat from Russia remains \"dangerous but ambiguous,\" and it is not certain that an attack will take place, a senior Ukrainian official told CNN.\n\nBut US President Joe Biden told Zelensky on a call Thursday that there was a distinct possibility Russia could launch an invasion in February, according to National Security Council Spokesperson Emily Horne.\n\nTaking that into account, here's a look at how soon an incursion could happen:\n\nAnalysts say Russia has a menu of options to attack at any moment it chooses, from shock-and-awe style air strikes to a ground invasion along a broad front. But while it has moved large amounts of military equipment into place in areas bordering Ukraine, not all the personnel needed for a ground operation are ready.\n\n\"At the moment, Russia has a lot of equipment pre-positioned along with its own border with Ukraine,\" said Janes, a global agency for open-source defense intelligence. \"(This) reduces the amount of time it requires for them to fill that area with more forces if they decide to fight because all of their heavy equipment's there.\"\n\nTroops can be deployed in less than 72 hours, the agency said, since they need only be sent from their bases by plane or train across the country.\n\nRussia is also in the process of deploying \"quite a sizable formation\" in Belarus from its Eastern Military District (EMD), which extends from Russia's Pacific Coast to Siberia, Janes said. This formation, which Janes first detected moving west early this month, appears to include troops, logistics and communications resources as well as military equipment.\n\nRussia has said the force is there for a Russian-Belarusian training exercise. But according to Janes, the troops \"are essentially deploying as close to ready to go as you can be.\"\n\nJudging by what has been pre-positioned on Russian soil near Ukraine's border, it considers Russia would require \"maybe a maximum of two weeks of intense movement to bring all of the pieces into position\" if it were to launch an invasion.\n\nWhether Russia would want to put large numbers of boots on the ground remains unclear, particularly given the risk of casualties.\n\n\"The important thing to realize is that (Russia) is quite wary of what it calls contact warfare,\" that is, forces fighting each on the ground, said Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst with the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).\n\n\"We've seen (this) in Chechnya, in Afghanistan, in Georgia and its covert deployments to Ukraine, that military losses actually do generate political pressure.\"\n\nRussia could instead opt to use its very long-range intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets to target critical national infrastructure within Ukraine, such as military bases or even power plants and bridges, Cranny-Evans said. \"The goal is to either stop a contact conflict from emerging or shape the battlefield so that when one does emerge, it's much more favorable to the Russian forces,\" he said.\n\nUS intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine \"as soon as early 2022.\" Since then, US officials have stuck to that line.\n\n\"In terms of timelines, what we've seen up until now has been very overt signaling of the intention for the ability to invade Ukraine,\" said Cranny-Evans. But the Russians are \"taking their time\" to get the final pieces into place in order to leave space for conversations which might allow them to achieve their political goals, such as installing a pro-Kremlin or even neutral leader in Kiev, without having to fight, he suggested.\n\nIf it does come to an invasion, he considers that Russia could move the necessary troops into place in the space of 72 hours. \"It's the forces that Russia already has in the Southern Military District on the borders with Ukraine that would probably take on the first bit of fighting,\" Cranny-Evans said.\n\nThe Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that it is NATO's support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- that constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank.\n\nRead the full story -- which also looks at what a potential invasion might look like -- here:",

What are the reinforcements they do?\n\nRussia may use one of its most terrifying weapons against America and Ukraine\n\nAtlanta, United States (CNN)- The United States has seen indicators that Russia has placed blood supplies near the borders of Ukraine, according to a senior US official at the Ministry of Defense, as part of its accumulation of medical supplies, forces and military equipment in the region that US officials said may indicate plansInvade.\n\nReuters was the first to report Russia's transfer of blood supplies to the border with Ukraine, which would be necessary to treat victims in a state of conflict.The development added that the United States fears that Russia has the capabilities to launch an attack in a very short time.\n\nCNN reported last month that Russia has begun to establish supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could continue in a long -term conflict if Moscow chooses the invasion.\n\nUkraine denied the transfer of any blood supply to the front lines.On Saturday, the Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defense, Hanna Mali, described reports as \"incorrect\".\n\n\"This information is incorrect.

Meanwhile, the communist governments of former Eastern European satellite countries were overthrown and granted independence, including East Germany which was reunited with the west at the destruction of the Berlin Wall.\n\nThe countries in the belt between Germany and Russia soon recognized their need to join NATO, Satter said, as they stood vulnerable if Russia were to regain power again.\n\n\"Russia objected but the United States insisted that any country is free to join NATO,\" he said. \"That it\u2019s a decision to be made by that country itself.\"\n\nBut, according to Satter, Russia was insistent about Ukraine not joining NATO and would consider it a \"provocation\" if the union were to take place.\n\n\n\nNATO allies began to back off from encouraging Ukraine and Georgia to join and even declined to extend an invitation to both countries at the Bucharest Summit in 2008.\n\n\"This was, to a certain extent, a reaction to Russian pressure - but the Russians reacted almost immediately with an invasion of Georgia,\" he said. \"Which could be interpreted to be a demonstration that NATO made a mistake by not establishing a strong position that it would protect these countries against external aggression.\"\n\nSince then, there have been no efforts to recruit Ukraine or Georgia as NATO members; only efforts to uphold friendly relations with the United States. Satter explained that extending membership to Ukraine could be a possibility in the future, but \"nothing more.\"\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION\n\n\"And, in fact, nothing has changed recently,\" he said. \"There was no move, whatever to make Ukraine a member of NATO at the time that Putin began making his threats.\"\n\nPresently, Russia has built up its military at the Ukrainian border and has prepared necessary equipment for invasion. Even though the Ukrainians are determined to resist, if necessary, Putin\u2019s position to launch a war is \"unpredictable,\" Satter said.\n\n\"I think this is an opportunity that Putin is seizing. I think he feels that he can intimidate the U.S. and NATO, that he can extract concessions, that he can intimidate the Ukrainians, and that he can demonstrate that he's in charge to the Russian people,\" he said. \"Anything that seems to show that Russia is a great power.\"\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the history of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, subscribe to Fox Nation and watch \"Fox Nation 101: Ukraine Crisis\" today.",

        "content": "Moscow CNN \u2014\n\nAs war talk over Ukraine reached fever pitch and invasion fears crested over the past week, one world leader remained decidedly above the fray: Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNo, Putin wasn\u2019t on vacation. The Kremlin leader kept up a full schedule, but he made scant public remarks about an international crisis that had reached full boil.\n\nLast Wednesday, the United States and NATO delivered their written responses to Russian security demands, offering Moscow what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described as a diplomatic off-ramp from a dangerous path of escalation toward war.\n\nAnd then, dead air. On Thursday, Putin spent the day paying a solemn public visit to Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery to mark the anniversary of the lifting of the Siege of Leningrad, the Soviet-era name for St. Petersburg, laying flowers at a common grave that contains the remains of his elder brother, Viktor, who died as an infant during the blockade.\n\nOn Friday, Putin chaired a national security meeting. But again, the Kremlin gave only an anodyne readout and released a brief snippet of Putin discussing a new foreign policy document.\n\nWhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov offered a few curt assessments of the letter \u2013 saying the Russians had \u201cno positive reaction\u201d on the main sticking point, the Kremlin\u2019s call for a halt to further NATO expansion to the East \u2013 it was clear that the world would have to wait for a more fulsome response from Putin.\n\nAnd Putin can wait. While Western leaders have worked themselves into a lather over the Ukraine crisis, Putin is a man who faces very little domestic political pressure. His political opposition has been sidelined or put in jail, he has a pliant state media and doesn\u2019t have to think about any re-election campaign in the near future. He does not have to consult with an unruly parliament on foreign affairs.\n\nThat makes him the man to talk to. On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron held a phone call with Putin on the Ukraine crisis, with the Elys\u00e9e saying Putin told Macron that \u201che was the only one he could have such a deep discussion with.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin summary of the call signaled Putin\u2019s dissatisfaction with responses from the US and NATO, saying the letters \u201cdid not take into account such fundamental concerns of Russia as preventing NATO expansion, refusing to deploy strike weapons systems near Russian borders, as well as returning the military strength and infrastructure of the [NATO] bloc in Europe to the positions of 1997,\u201d but the statement gave little indication how and when Putin planned to respond formally.\n\nOn Monday, State Department officials said they had \u201creceived a written follow-up from Russia,\u201d but on Tuesday the Kremlin said there had been a \u201cmixup\u201d over the issue, insisting that Russia has yet to send its \u201cmain reply\u201d to the US.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the correspondence from Russia \u201cregarded a different matter. The main reply \u2026 hasn\u2019t been handed over, it\u2019s still being prepared.\u201d\n\nA member of the Ukrainian military climbs down from a lookout point in a defensive front line position on Thursday, January 27, 2022, near Shyrokyne, Ukraine. Photograph by Timothy Fadek/Redux Timothy Fadek/Redux for CNN\n\nMacron, who is gearing up for a presidential campaign, wasn\u2019t the only one busying himself with the crisis. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2013 on the back foot over Downing Street lockdown gatherings and an animal rescue in Afghanistan \u2013 unveiled plans Friday to speak to Putin and travel to the region in his bid to defuse the crisis.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan made a separate bid to engage Putin, inviting the Russian president to attend a summit and offering to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin had accepted, depending on the resolution of the \u201cepidemiological situation,\u201d and no date has been fixed \u2013 although Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters Thursday he had been informed by the Kremlin it will be after Putin returns from the Beijing Olympic Games that start on February 4.\n\nSo does Putin hold all the cards? Will he bide his time through the Winter Olympics, where he will be a guest of Chinese President Xi Jinping? Is he an expert tactician, or a poor strategist? Divining Putin\u2019s master plan may be a pastime for pundits, but the Russian President has made his intentions very clear for a very long time.\n\nOne need not read Putin\u2019s mind. His words speak for themselves.\n\nBack in 2007, Putin laid out his main grievances at the Munich Security Forum. His argument? The expansion of the NATO alliance to include former members of the Warsaw Pact and the Baltic States was an act of aggression directed at Russia.\n\n\u201cI think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the Alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: Against whom is this expansion intended?\u201d\n\nAnd then there was the stationing of US missile defense assets in Europe. In Putin\u2019s view, missile defense \u2013 which Washington billed as a counter to rogue states such as Iran and North Korea \u2013 was actually designed to undercut Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent.\n\nMore ominously, Putin said this: \u201cI am confident that the historians of the future will not describe our conference as one in which the Second Cold War was declared. But they could.\u201d\n\nThat conflict \u2013 call it Cold War Lite, or Cold War 2.0 \u2013 has gradually gained momentum since then, through successive crises: Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war in Donbas; the Kremlin\u2019s intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war in 2015; Russian meddling in the 2016 US election; the 2018 Salisbury poisonings in England; and so on.\n\nPutin also built a rationale for war in the summer when he published a 5,000-word historical essay, arguing, in essence, that Ukrainians and Russians were a single nation. Independent Ukraine, in his view, was an \u201cartificial division\u201d of two peoples \u2013 and therefore not a real state.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Peskov has said Putin and his government \u201cwill not rush to judgements.\u201d Now that the Second Cold War is threatening to turn into a very hot one, the world must wait to see if Putin\u2019s next move signals a turn for the worse in global affairs.",

The troops from Germany will deploy to Romania, the 82 Airborne soldiers will go to Poland, and the 18th Airborne forces will go to Germany.\n\nRUSSIA-UKRAINE: US SENDING MORE TROOPS TO NATO'S EASTERN FLANK: LIVE UPDATES\n\n\"These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine,\" Kirby maintained. \"They\u2019re going to ensure a robust defense of our NATO allies.\"\n\nThere are already approximately 900 U.S. troops in Romania.\n\n\"This force is designed to deter aggression and enhance our defensive capabilities, and we expect them, as I said, to move in the coming days,\" Kirby said.\n\nBIDEN WARNS RUSSIA OF 'SWIFT AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES' IF THEY 'WALK AWAY' FROM DIPLOMACY AND ATTACK UKRAINE\n\nHe added that the force from Fort Bragg is \"trained and equipped for a variety of missions to deter aggression and to reassure and to defend our allies.\"\n\nBut Kirby said that the 8,500 troops that Austin put on heightened standby \"are not currently being deployed, but remain ready to move if called for the NATO response force or as needed for other contingencies as directed by the secretary or by President Biden.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the U.S. is moving troops due to evidence Putin plans to cross Ukraine\u2019s borders, Kirby maintained that it is \"important that we send a strong signal to Mr. Putin and frankly, to the world that NATO matters to the United States, it matters to our allies.\"\n\n\"And we have ironclad Article Five commitments,\" Kirby added. \"An attack on one is an attack on all.\"\n\nAt this point, though, the Pentagon said they have \"clear evidence every day\" that Putin is continuing to \"destabilize the environment by adding more forces into the western part of the country and along Belarus, in addition to additional naval activity in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic.\"\n\n\"He clearly is providing himself many options, lots more capabilities for exactly what purpose? We don't know right now. And because we don't know exactly what his purpose is, we want to make sure we're ready on the NATO front to defend our allies,\" Kirby said.\n\nKirby said the Pentagon is \"continuously reviewing our posture,\" and may soon have \"additional posture decisions to announce, including movements that are part of ongoing military exercises.\"\n\n\"This is not a sum total of the deterrence actions we will take or those to reassure our allies,\" he said. \"We stand united. We have said that repeatedly. We say it again today. These movements are unmistakable signals to the world that we stand ready to reassure our NATO allies and deter and defend against any aggression.\"\n\nKirby, though, doubled-down on the sentiment expressed by Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley last week.\n\nPENTAGON: RUSSIA BUILDUP ON UKRAINE BORDER IS LARGEST SINCE COLD WAR, CONFLICT WOULD BE 'HORRIFIC'\n\n\"We do not believe conflict is inevitable,\" Kirby said. \"The United States in lockstep with our allies and partners, has offered Russia a path to de-escalate.\"\n\nHe added: \"But we will take all prudent measures to assure our own security and that of our allies.\"\n\nLast week, top Pentagon officials said the build-up of Russian troops along Ukraine's border is the largest since the Cold War, and warned that conflict in Eastern Europe would be \"horrific,\" but stressed that it is \"not inevitable,\" maintaining that there is \"still time and space for diplomacy,\" as the Kremlin continues to threaten further incursion in Ukraine.\n\nAnd on Monday, President Biden threatened Russia with \"swift and severe consequences\" should Moscow choose to \"walk away from diplomacy and attack Ukraine,\" maintaining that the United States and allies are continuing \"to prepare for every scenario.\"\n\n\"The world must be clear-eyed about the actions Russia is threatening and ready to respond to the risks those actions present to all of us,\" he said, noting that Monday\u2019s meeting of the U.N. Security Council is a \"critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice: rejecting the use of force, calling for military deescalation, supporting diplomacy as the best path forward, and demanding accountability from every member state to refrain from military aggression against its neighbors.\"\n\nThe president\u2019s statement was made public as the U.N. Security Council met for the first time to discuss the ongoing situation \u2014 as Russia has stationed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine\u2019s borders, stoking fears of an invasion.\n\nAlso on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced that the Biden administration has developed \"specific sanctions packages\" for Russian elites and their family members if Moscow invades Ukraine.\n\nBiden, during a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week, warned of a \"distinct possibility\" of a Russian invasion in February.\n\nZelenskyy, though, said Ukraine is \"not seeing any escalation bigger than before,\" and said the Russian build-up of troops could be an attempt by Moscow to exert \"psychological pressure\" and sow panic.\n\nBut Russia has denied it intends to launch an attack. Russian officials said NATO must promise not to allow Ukraine to join the alliance, among other demands, which the United States and NATO have rejected.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that \"hysteria promoted by Washington triggers hysteria in Ukraine, where people are almost starting to pack their bags for the front line.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRussia Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya on Monday slammed the West, claiming it is trying to will a Ukrainian war into existence.\n\n\"The deployment of Russian troops within our own territory has frequently occurred on varying scales before and has not caused any hysterics whatsoever,\" he said. \"The discussions about a threat of war is provocative in it of itself.\"\n\nNebenzya added: \"You are almost calling for this, you want it to happen, you are waiting for it to happen as if you want to make your words become a reality.\"\n\nUkraine's territory has long been in Putin's crosshairs, especially amid recent NATO considerations of potentially allowing Ukraine to join the alliance.

No one abstained or voted against the resolution, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.\n\nAccording to the resolution, a free Ukraine is one of the guarantors of Poland's security. Poland was the first country to recognize Ukraine's independence, and the next Polish governments supported the strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw.\n\n\"Today, Ukraine faces a mortal danger - the threat of a new invasion. Therefore, it is very important that the Polish authorities reliably support our neighbor, as there is no secure Poland without an independent Ukraine,\" the resolution reads.\n\nAccording to the document, Poland's Senate supports the provision of political and financial assistance to Ukraine, the supply of weapons, as well as the participation of NATO military in training Ukrainian service members. It is emphasized that all actions aimed at deterring the aggressor have a huge impact on the morale of the Ukrainian people.\n\nAccording to the document, Russia has amassed a huge army on Ukraine's borders, including tanks, artillery, ships and combat aircraft.\n\n\"The purpose of this escalation of tensions is to destabilize Europe. This could lead to an outbreak of the largest armed conflict since World War II,\" Polish senators said.\n\nIn 1994, the United States, Britain and Russia pledged to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to refrain from any threat of force against its independence in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear capabilities. Ukraine has fulfilled its obligations, but Russia nevertheless attacked Ukraine in 2014, annexed Crimea and controls separatists in the Donbas, the resolution said.\n\n\"Before another Russian invasion, Ukraine is unconditionally supported by the North Atlantic Alliance, the EU and the United States. Authorities in Kyiv began strategic cooperation with NATO in 1997, and Allies in 2008 agreed to its future membership. Today, we are facing the test of this open door policy,\" the resolution reads.\n\nIt is noted that the Senate is convinced of the possibility of dialogue with Russia. However, this cannot happen in the face of military blackmail, undermining the principles of inviolability of borders in Europe and hybrid attacks on democratic institutions.\n\n\"The condition for this dialogue is the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Ukrainian border,\" the senators said.\n\nAfter its adoption, the document will be published in the government's Monitor Polski newspaper.\n\nUkraine's Ambassador to Poland Andrii Deshchytsia was present in the Senate hall during the vote.

        "content": "As military analysts warn of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, they also are keeping an eye on the weather. Temperatures, cloud cover or even the radioactivity in the soil could determine when and where Russian troops make a possible move.\n\nFor centuries, armies and nations have waged wars on these same lands, from the steppes to the Eastern European heartland, and have faced similar obstacles \u2014 from mucky wetlands to rushing rivers and treacherous mountain ranges.\n\nRussia, while mobilizing more than 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border, denies it plans to invade. But Washington and its allies are preparing for possible aggression by sending military personnel and equipment to NATO members near Ukraine.\n\nNow, with airstrike capabilities and state-of-the-art materiel on both sides, geography and weather are less of a factor than they were in the past. But they still could influence the timing and the tide of a potential conflict. Cold weather provides hard, fast terrain countrywide for an invasion, experts said. Warmer weather starting in later February and into March brings with it thawing grounds, leading to muddy conditions that are less than ideal for heavy military vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt is very inconvenient to carry out offensive operations in the spring,\u201d said Kirill Mikhailov, an analyst at the Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent Russian open-source investigative organization that monitors Russia\u2019s military. \u201cBecause the thaw turns ravines into creeks, and creeks into rivers. If you carry out an operation, it should be carried out either in January or February.\u201d\n\nThe Pinsk Marshes\n\nTo Ukraine\u2019s north span roughly 100,000 square miles of wetlands known as the Pinsk Marshes. Here is one place the cold could really play a role. During the winter, these mucky flatlands freeze over, providing a more stable terrain for heavy military vehicles that would otherwise get stuck in the mud.\n\nExperts say the frozen ground, usually present in February, could provide Russian troops with the best window to cross into Ukraine. While more roads have recently been built throughout the marshes, traversing the open terrain would be strategically important.\n\n\u201cThose fields become critical because you can\u2019t risk bottlenecks on a roadway,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \u201cYou run into real problems on very muddy terrain in the March-April time frame.\u201d\n\nHistorically the marshes have been an obstacle to forces. But muddy landscape might not be a deciding factor this time around, according to a written analysis by the Center for Naval Analyses Russia Studies Program (CNA) in response to questions from The Washington Post. \u201cWhile these marshes were flagged as a potential hazard for Western forces fighting a hypothetical war in the U.S.S.R. and considered \u2018impassible except during winter,\u2019 Russian troops have long proved quite adept at handling marsh and swamp terrain.\u201d\n\nDuring World War II, the marshes posed a challenge to German forces invading during Operation Barbarossa.\n\nBelarusian Border\n\nThe marshes are spread across another key strategic location: the Belarusian border. As the ground freezes, it could give Russian troops access to Kyiv, which falls a mere 56 miles to the south, though that most-direct route passes through the nuclear disaster site of Chernobyl.\n\nRussia has begun mobilizing forces ahead of joint Belarus-Russian military exercises, scheduled to take place Feb. 10 to Feb. 20. CNA said Russia has sent more than 10 battalion tactical groups to Belarus, as well as naval and airborne units.\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has vowed to defend his country and Russia against Ukrainian \u201caggression.\u201d\n\n\u2018The Zone\u2019\n\nRussian forces seeking the most direct route to Kyiv could run into another obstacle: Chernobyl. The site of a nuclear disaster in 1986, the 1,000-square-mile zone is heavily restricted to keep people safe from radioactivity still embedded in the ground.\n\nIn November, Ukraine deployed border guards to patrol the area as tensions with Russia and Belarus heightened. While certain areas are safe to occupy for some time, the explosions and artillery fire of warfare in the area could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cThe delivery of air-to-surface munitions, artillery, mortar and multiple rocket-launcher fire in the Belarus-Ukraine border area could also disperse radioactive debris in the soil,\u201d said Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer.\n\nThe Dnieper River\n\nWhile an invasion from Belarus\u2019s south would be the most direct route to Ukraine\u2019s capital, many expect potential Russian military aggression to also come from the northeast and east, where pro-Moscow separatists control Ukrainian territory in Donbas, and more than 100,000 Russian troops have amassed on the country\u2019s border with Ukraine.\n\nThey could come through Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-most-populous city. There are no geographic obstacles separating this eastern metropolis from Russia, making it a fast and prime target.\n\nMoving west, any invading force would reach the banks of the Dnieper River, which symbolically divides Ukraine into east and west, beginning in Russia and flowing through Belarus and Ukraine into the Black Sea.\n\nThe waterway, home to critical infrastructure including dams, would be a key consideration in an invasion from Belarus or Russia.\n\nZaporizhzhya\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhya, for example, is the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, a massive dam that also joins the banks of the river.\n\nIn World War II, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s secret police destroyed this dam to make the river harder for German forces to cross, killing civilians and flooding towns in the process. The dam has since been rebuilt, and experts note that Ukraine could repeat the tactic, this time to slow down a Russian invasion, washing out oncoming forces.\n\nBut Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., a senior fellow for imagery analysis at CSIS, cautioned that the move could again drown Ukrainian towns. \u201cIf they blew the dams they\u2019d do as much damage to the Ukrainian population as they would a Russian invasion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Black Sea\n\nIn Ukraine\u2019s south is the Black Sea, an important body of water that serves as the country\u2019s shipping route with its connection to the Mediterranean. The Black Sea has been the site of numerous conflicts throughout history, including the Russo-Turkish wars, the Crimean War in the 1850s and World War II.\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, giving the country expanded access to the sea.\n\nNow, CNA said: \u201cThe Russian Navy depends on transit through the Black Sea for supplying military presence in Syria and for rotating ships in and out of its Mediterranean squadron.\u201d\n\nSince 2014, the organization added, the Russian navy\u2019s Black Sea Fleet has \u201cexpanded and modernized.\u201d Twenty of its ships were recently \u201cengaged in a major naval exercise in the Black Sea,\u201d as part of a \u201clarge-scale naval exercise involving all Russian fleets.\u201d\n\nOther Western naval vessels enter the Black Sea periodically, but those that stray too close to Crimea often face brushes with Russian warships, as Moscow sees these moves as a direct challenge to its annexation of the peninsula.\n\nThe Kerch Strait\n\nThe Kerch Strait divides the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and could be another access point for Russia. In 2018, Russia opened a 12-mile-long, $4 billion bridge over the strait, directly linking Russia to Crimea. Ukraine and the West have called the bridge another illegal infringement on Kyiv\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains\n\nA mountain range runs through Ukraine\u2019s west, forming a natural barrier that stretches from Romania through Slovakia. The higher-ground vantage points of its peaks made them coveted territory in past conflicts. Russians battled Austro-Hungarian troops during the winter of 1915 in World War I, and soldiers froze in the snowy terrain.",

        "content": "If, as seems increasingly probable, Russia decides not to launch an all-out invasion of Ukraine, tub-thumping US and British politicians who have spent weeks scaring the public with loose talk of looming Armageddon will have some explaining to do.\n\nThe military build-up directed by Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, is real enough. But suspicion grows that the actual as opposed to the hypothetical threat of a large-scale conventional attack is being mis-read, misinterpreted, over-estimated or deliberately exaggerated.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\n\nThis view is shared in part by Ukraine\u2019s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who last week demanded that the US president, Joe Biden, stop suggesting invasion was \u201cimminent\u201d. Wild American talk of war was damaging his country and stoking panic, he said.\n\nFulminating against \u201cself-fulfilling prophecies\u201d, Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, is also trying to calm the rhetoric. He and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has refused to join the armchair warriors, may soon meet Putin for talks in Moscow.\n\nWarning lights flashed red in late January when British intelligence officials briefed anonymously that invasion could be \u201ctwo to three weeks away\u201d. This echoed alarmist US predictions of conflict \u201cat any time\u201d.\n\nA furious war on truth is already under way. Russia claims US mercenaries are active in Ukraine. Dubious allegations of a plot to oust Zelenskiy were floated by Liz Truss\u2019s Foreign Office. Washington says a fake video, not yet seen by anyone, shows a staged attack on Russian forces.\n\nAs Britain\u2019s Boris Johnson, keen to show fealty and distract from partygate, warned of a \u201clightning\u201d strike, Biden talked in messianic terms about a \u201cworld-changing\u201d conflict, beginning in February. They may yet be right.\n\nBut February has arrived, and still no war. As Biden orders the 82nd Airborne Division to eastern Europe this weekend, Putin is chilling with his \u201cdear friend\u201d, President Xi Jinping, at the winter Olympics in Beijing \u2013 not an obvious spot from which to launch a blitzkrieg.\n\nDeploring \u201cwestern hysteria\u201d, the Kremlin denies any intention to invade. Putin said last week he hoped \u201cdialogue\u201d would succeed \u2013 while refusing to pull back his forces. Putin is not a man to be trusted. His reasoning is twisted, his brinkmanship notorious, his instincts brutal. But he does seem to have been given pause by the feverish US response.\n\nHe now appears focused on extracting maximum diplomatic advantage, meaning concessions on European security, Nato, and new US medium-range missile deployments, while maintaining military pressure. Putin has also given Kyiv\u2019s \u201cwestern puppets\u201d a nasty shock. That may have been his game-plan all along.\n\nIf this phoney war ends with a whimper, not a bang, Johnson and other mini-Churchills will declare victory, saying they faced down aggression. European leaders will argue that diplomacy was vindicated.\n\nEven so, relieved people across Europe, subjected daily to over-heated predictions of mayhem, will be entitled to ask: what, really, was all that about? Was the intelligence wrong \u2013 again?\n\nThe answer, in a word, is China.\n\nIt\u2019s true Biden strongly backs Nato, which underpins US interests in Europe. It\u2019s true, too, that as a cold war veteran, his instinct is to uphold democracy and freedom in countries threatened by Moscow.\n\nYet the overriding, urgent thrust of his foreign policy to date has focused on the Indo-Pacific region, and specifically on America\u2019s greatest challenger, China \u2013 not on Europe.\n\nSo when the US was confronted by a possibly precedent-setting attack on a sovereign nation, the chilling implications for self-governing Taiwan and Beijing\u2019s other target territories quickly became central to White House calculations.\n\nBiden knows any sign of weakness over Ukraine may be read in Beijing as indicating fatal weakness over Taiwan\n\nTaiwan is not a war the US would necessarily win. It\u2019s not a war Biden wants to fight. But he knows any sign of weakness in confronting Putin over Ukraine may be read in Beijing as indicating fatal weakness over Taiwan.\n\nWhen he cites \u201cworld-changing\u201d threats, Biden is talking principally about this accelerating, unboundaried 21st-century contest with China. In a globalised world, few if any conflicts occur in isolation.\n\nIn this sense, Ukraine is an early skirmish in what historians may one day view as a new hundred years war. Restless Kazakhstan, where Putin recently deployed troops with Beijing\u2019s blessing, is another frontline. Others include potential or actual conflict zones from the Baltic republics and Belarus to Libya, Syria, Myanmar, the Indian frontier, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.\n\nChina and Russia are moving into ever closer alliance. Their leaders share the same post-Communist, authoritarian, nationalist ideology. Both view the US as the champion of an international, democratic, rules-based system they want to tear down. Both believe America is in terminal decline.\n\nEven before this weekend\u2019s tryst, Putin and Xi had formed a common front to resist western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine and on China over its Hong Kong crackdown and Uyghur genocide. Now they are doubling down.\n\nThe two countries play an \u201cimportant stabilising role\u201d in global affairs, rendering international relations \u201cmore equitable and inclusive\u201d, Putin told Xinhua news agency.\n\nWhile military cooperation and trade are growing rapidly, new deals on gas supplies to China, Russia\u2019s biggest energy customer, are also in the pipeline. A Nato-style mutual defence treaty may not be far off.\n\nThe birth of this Sino-Russian axis, conceived in opposition to the US-led western democracies, is the most globally significant strategic development since the Soviet Union collapsed 30 years ago. It will define the coming age.\n\nFear of what China might do helps explain Biden\u2019s frenetic, sometimes hyperbolic, response to the siege of Kyiv. It\u2019s important Putin be shown bullying does not work. But this crisis, fundamentally, is not solely about Ukraine or even Europe. Writ large, it\u2019s about the whole scary, contested, disorderly new world that awaits.",

They know that. We have shown that we are capable to respond quickly to threats. Troops were not many. If needed, we would have increased their numbers there. Belarus guarded the airfields near Almaty, and Russia - in Nursultan,\" Aleksandr Lukashenko said.\n\nThe head of state is convinced that the West understands the futility of a war with the CSTO forces. \"In Europe, it will be easier. Don't they see it? They understand that it is futile to fight against us, first of all, against Russia. I am not talking about nuclear weapons and other weapons. But they'd better back off!\" the president warned.\n\nVladimir Soloviev, in turn, noted that the West itself does not want to go to war with the CSTO, but plans to provoke a conflict with Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine will never fight against us: this war will last three to four days a most. There will be no one there to fight against us. The reports of people training with wooden rifles... You and I can make a video on a mobile phone of us training in the next hall,\" Aleksandr Lukashenko said. \u201cSs soon things have started to get a bit more serious, Volodya Zelensky immediately chickened out.\"",

        "content": "The current western narrative on the Ukraine crisis is that Russia is a machiavellian power with an expansionist agenda. That view is shaping our response: we are matching Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression, meeting strength with strength and threats with threats. But what if we tried to get inside the mind of the enemy, and ask what was motivating the aggression? By doing so, could we break this cycle \u2013 and offer Putin a way out, too?\n\nWhen the USSR deployed ballistic missiles to Cuba in the 1960s, their proximity to the US nearly unleashed a third world war. Sitting in Moscow today, does Putin see being encircled by Nato as an equivalent threat? After all, one of his core demands is that Nato curbs its expansion close to the Russian border, and that Ukraine must not join. Russia claims that the US repeatedly told Soviet leaders it would incorporate Russia into a cooperative European security framework. In practice, Nato emerged as a US-dominated security frame with about 75,000 US troops still on European soil. Great powers always treat with suspicion and hostility the presence of rival great powers on their borders.\n\nPutin was always bitter about the collapse of the Soviet Union. He bided his time, and in 2014 Russia seized Crimea and sent troops into Ukraine\u2019s mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region to support the separatist movement.\n\nRussia today is no benign liberal democracy and President Putin has an intelligence mindset, playing poker, not chess. He is prepared to threaten war, create chaos and spread misinformation to push back Nato from Russia\u2019s borders. Using coercive diplomacy, he has amassed more than 130,000 troops on the eastern border of Ukraine, a continued threat to its sovereignty.\n\nYet however provocative Russia\u2019s behaviour, western governments have a responsibility not to escalate the threat of war. The consequences of a direct US-Russian confrontation in Ukraine would be catastrophic on all sides. A full-scale conventional war could escalate into nuclear war. Even a limited war would create a ruinous global economic crisis that could destroy for the foreseeable future any chance of serious action against climate change.\n\nI have worked in conflict resolution for the past 20 years and seen the dangers of stumbling into wars, unable to stop or turn back. Selling weapons to a country may look like a principled act in support of an ally but it usually takes them deeper and deeper into the quagmire of conflict. The US and the UK have instigated and been involved in four failed wars this century, but we seem to have failed to have learned the lessons.\n\nThere are those who argue that sending military support to Ukraine strengthens Nato\u2019s hand at the negotiating table. Yet there are inherent dangers in this approach \u2013 the use of deterrence could be the very thing that escalates the situation.\n\nWashington and London have pledged to increase offensive military aid to Ukraine and have announced arms deliveries, ammunition and anti-tank weapons. The UK is seeking to put itself at the forefront of western efforts to forestall what the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has called the risk of a \u201clightning war\u201d in eastern Europe.\n\nGermany has been much more sceptical, blocking the transfer of German-made weapons from Baltic states to Ukraine. It has long argued against sending weapons to active conflict zones. Germany has declared that it is prepared to have a serious dialogue with Russia to defuse the highly dangerous situation, arguing that diplomacy is the only viable way.\n\nWhatever western governments feel about Moscow\u2019s behaviour, de-escalating the conflict and giving Moscow a ladder to climb down is in everyone\u2019s interest. We should not underestimate the link between humiliation and aggression. Putin is a very proud man, and smart politics by western governments should offer face-saving gestures if we are serious about avoiding war.\n\nAccording to Anatol Lieven, an academic and Ukraine specialist, this is \u201cthe most dangerous crisis in the world today; it is also in principle the most easily solved\u201d. A solution exists, drawn up by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in 2015, which involves the implementation of the Minsk II agreement. This offers demilitarisation, a restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty including control of the border with Russia, and full autonomy for the Donbas region. The main objection for Kyiv is that autonomy for the Donbas would prevent Ukraine from joining Nato and the EU.\n\nOne way through this would be for Nato to declare Ukraine a neutral country and decree that it does not join Nato for at least a decade. In practice, Ukrainian membership of the EU is ruled out for at least a generation because of Ukraine\u2019s corruption, political dysfunction and lack of economic progress.\n\nTalks between Putin and France\u2019s President Macron this week were more conciliatory in tone. Macron said: \u201cThere is no security for Europeans if there is no security for Russia.\u201d A permanent forum where Russia is welcome is needed to re-examine the post-cold war security system in Europe. This approach to issues such as missile deployments, arms control and transparency around military exercises could ease this conflict. Such a dialogue could create a climate of security cooperation with Russia.",

So that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we have this solidarity: that we do everything possible, through diplomacy, to try to avert a conflict and prevent aggression \u2013 but equally, to be resolute if Russia renews its aggression.\u201d\n\nRussia has accused the west of ignoring its requests for security guarantees, including an assurance that Ukraine never join Nato.\n\nBlinken was in Melbourne for a meeting with foreign ministers of the Quad, an increasingly active diplomatic grouping that is viewed warily by China, which sees it as an effort to contain its influence.\n\nThe meeting comes a week after China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin of Russia signed a joint statement calling on the west to \u201cabandon the ideologised approaches of the cold war\u201d, as the two leaders showcased their warming relationship in Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics.\n\nThis so-called \u201cno limits\u201d agreement was one of the developments discussed at Friday\u2019s meeting of the Quad foreign ministers.\n\nThe Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said Russia and China\u2019s agreement was \u201cconcerning because it doesn\u2019t represent a global order that squares with those ambitions for freedom and openness and sovereignty and the protection of territorial integrity\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference with her Quad counterparts, Payne said rules and norms were \u201cunder pressure, in particular from authoritarian regimes\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, Indian foreign minister, Dr S.

Photograph: Sandra Sanders/Reuters\n\n\u201cAustralia, in our actions, works to support a world order that favours freedom \u2013 where rules, not power and coercion, resolve disputes,\u201d she said.\n\nPayne reiterated Australia\u2019s \u201cstrong support for Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d and signalled Australia was ready to join an international sanctions package targeted at Russia.\n\nAustralia, she said, would \u201ccontinue to support our allies and partners to deter this sort of aggression and to raise the costs of this kind of behaviour\u201d.\n\nJapan\u2019s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said his country would continue to collaborate with the international community and \u201ctake appropriate responses\u201d.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting was productive, said India\u2019s minister of external affairs, Dr S. Jaishankar. He said the Quad had a positive agenda, including on vaccine distribution. He said the Quad stood \u201cfor something, not against somebody\u201d.\n\nThe joint statement issued by the Quad foreign ministers did not directly name China, but stressed \u201cthe importance of adherence to international law\u201d to meet \u201cchallenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the South and East China Seas\u201d \u2013 where China is engaged in territorial disputes.\n\nClearly alluding to China, the statement also said the Quad countries \u201coppose coercive economic policies and practices that run counter to this system and will work collectively to foster global economic resilience against such actions\u201d.\n\nThe Quad would support neighbours in the Indo-Pacific region to \u201cbuild resilience and counter disinformation\u201d, it said. It would also assist countries in the region \u201cto address the growing threat of ransomware, by strengthening capacity building to ensure resilient cyber security and to counter cybercrime\u201d.\n\nA year after the military coup in Myanmar, the foreign ministers said they were \u201cgravely\u201d concerned about the crisis in the south-east Asian country. They called for \u201can end to violence, the release of all those arbitrarily detained, including foreigners, and unhindered humanitarian access\u201d.\n\nThe group also condemned North Korea for its \u201cdestabilising ballistic missile launches in violation of UN Security Council resolutions\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, met with the visiting foreign ministers and said he appreciated their support as Australia weathered \u201ccoercion and pressure\u201d from China.\n\n\u201cWe live in a very fragile, fragmented and contested world, and that is no more accentuated than here in our Indo-Pacific,\u201d Morrison told the earlier meeting.\n\nBlinken said a confrontation with China was not inevitable, but \u201cwe share concerns that in recent years China has been acting more aggressively, a whole lot more aggressively in the region, and, indeed, potentially beyond\u201d.",

        "content": "Melbourne, Australia CNN \u2014\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine \u201ccould begin at any time,\u201d including during the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the United States continues \u201cto see very troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border.\u201d\n\nThe top US diplomat made the comments alongside his counterparts from the Quad \u2013 Australia, India and Japan \u2013 following a day of meetings in Melbourne and after the State Department and President Joe Biden warned US citizens to depart Ukraine immediately.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re in a window when an invasion could begin at any time \u2013 and to be clear that includes during the Olympics,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nThe US and its allies have new intelligence that suggests Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine even before the end of the Olympics, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nPrior to the start of the Olympics earlier this month, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman suggested that the Winter Games, which are hosted by China, could impact Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s thinking about the timing of a potential invasion. Putin traveled to Beijing for the beginning of the Olympics and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two released a lengthy pact pledging no limits to their cooperation.\n\nBlinken told reporters at the joint news conference Friday that the US was \u201ccontinuing to draw down our embassy\u201d in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and \u201cwill continue that process.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve also been very clear that any American citizens who remain in Ukraine should leave now,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Washington, the White House convened a meeting with several Cabinet members and senior national security officials in the Situation Room on Thursday night to discuss Russia\u2019s ongoing military buildup near Ukraine, two officials familiar with the matter told CNN. There have been several Situation Room meetings in recent weeks and months to discuss the brewing crisis, one of the sources said, but the meetings have grown more urgent in recent days as Russia has continued to move forces, weapons and logistical equipment into the area and increased troop readiness.\n\nBiden will hold a call with other world leaders at 11:00 a.m. ET Friday on the situation in Ukraine, a White House official told CNN. The leaders of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, NATO, the European Commission and the European Council will be on the call, according to the official.\n\nLast month, the State Department authorized the departure of nonemergency personnel from the US Embassy in Kyiv and ordered family members to depart the country, and on Thursday it issued a new travel advisory for American citizens in Ukraine to \u201cdepart now via commercial or private means.\u201d\n\nAlthough Friday\u2019s Quad discussions focused primarily on matters related to the Indo-Pacific region, Russia\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine was discussed among the four foreign ministers.\n\nThe top US diplomat repeatedly noted that the crisis goes deeper than the physical threat posed by Russia to Ukraine and could undercut the international rules-based order that the Quad countries have vowed to uphold.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not simply, as important as it is, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence but very basic principles that have, in a hard-fought way after two World Wars and a Cold War, undergirded security, peace and prosperity for countries around the world \u2013 principles like one country can\u2019t simply change the borders of another by force; principles like one country can\u2019t simply dictate to another its choices, its policies, with who it will associate; principles like one country can\u2019t exert a sphere of influence to subjugate its neighbors to its will,\u201d Blinken said.\n\n\u201cIf we allow those principles to be challenged with impunity, even if it\u2019s half a world away in Europe, that will have an impact here as well,\u201d he continued. \u201cOthers are watching. Others are looking to all of us to see how we respond. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we have this solidarity, that we do everything is possible through diplomacy, to try to avert a conflict and prevent aggression, but equally be resolute if Russia renews its aggression.\u201d\n\nBlinken said that although the Biden administration is \u201crelentlessly\u201d focused on trying to resolve the Russia-Ukraine crisis, his presence in Australia for the Quad meetings \u201cunderscores our commitment to staying focused on the Indo-Pacific.\u201d\n\nState Department officials are busy preparing for a wide range of potential meetings between US and Russian officials that may or may not happen as concerns continue to grow over a potential Russian invasion, two department officials told CNN.\n\nThe range of possible meetings include a meeting between Biden and Putin, a meeting between Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov or lower-level meetings.\n\nBlinken said last month that the ball is in Russia\u2019s court, and the officials said that remains the case when it comes to future diplomatic engagements. The United States gave Moscow a written response aimed at deterring a Russian invasion of Ukraine more than two weeks ago, and is waiting for Russia\u2019s response.\n\nWhen asked about the preparations underway, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cWe remain open to meeting again with the Russians. And we will continue to closely coordinate with our allies and partners and abide by our north star: nothing about Europe without Europe.\u201d The spokesperson added, \u201cNothing about NATO without NATO. And nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. The (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) is also an important forum for diplomatic engagement.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that the US is keeping the doors of communication open with the Russians, and did not count out a possible meeting between Biden and Putin.\n\n\u201cWe have not put that off the table but it has to be under the right circumstances,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said of any possible Putin-Biden meeting.\n\nDiplomacy between the US and Russia has stalled in recent weeks. But Moscow has been actively engaged with other world leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron met Putin this week in Russia and the UK foreign minister met with Lavrov, also in Russia.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of diplomacy underway. President Biden spoke with President Macron after his diplomatic efforts, and we are engaged in regular conversations with our allies and partners, including UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who was recently in Moscow,\u201d the State Department spokesperson said.\n\nThe Biden administration has still not referred to the ongoing diplomacy with Russia in recent months as negotiations, preferring to hold out that descriptor for when the talks actually dig into substantive details.\n\nIn Melbourne, the foreign ministers said they discussed maritime security, including freedom of navigation and combating illegal fishing, strengthening cybersecurity and counterterrorism, building resilient supply chains and providing vaccines to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOur region is in a period of rising strategic uncertainty,\u201d Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said at the news conference. \u201cThe rules and norms that have provided a foundation for our stability, and hence our prosperity are under pressure, in particular from authoritarian regimes.\u201d\n\nAsked by CNN whether the Quad had concerns about the lengthy cooperation agreement recently released by Putin and Xi, Payne said it was not about what the Quad was against but rather what it supports: \u201cfreedom and openness and transparency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere we see the sort of statement that was issued by the (Russian and Chinese) Presidents after the bilateral meeting, it is concerning because it doesn\u2019t present or represent a global order that squares with those ambitions for freedom and openness and sovereignty and the protection of territorial integrity,\u201d she said.\n\nIndian Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar did not voice similar concerns but rather reiterated that Quad is \u201cfor something, not against somebody.\u201d",

        "content": "Gabrielle Rifkind\u2019s point that a willingness to compromise by all sides is the only way out of an unfolding international crisis certainly holds true (I\u2019m a conflict mediator. This is our way out of the Ukraine crisis, 9 February). The USSR did pull its missiles out of Cuba as Rifkind states, but the US reciprocated by withdrawing comparable missiles from Turkey and promised not to invade the island.\n\nIn 2013 in Ukraine, in the midst of a worsening political crisis, France, Germany, Russia and Poland and the then Ukrainian government led by Viktor Yanukovych and most of the Ukrainian opposition thrashed out a peace plan to take the country forward. The more nationalist elements of Ukrainian society, backed by hawks in the US and elsewhere, rejected the plan and there followed a constitutional crisis, a Russian invasion and dismemberment of Ukraine. No nuclear annihilation for the world, but a real catastrophe for the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn the aftermath of all of this, in 2014 and 2015, a second peace plan was put on the table, the Minsk framework, revisited in the last few days and weeks following talk of a Russian invasion. Could its provisions for devolved self-government for the east of Ukraine, alongside the sanctity of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, be the prelude to a peaceful transition that would benefit both sides of Ukraine\u2019s body politic? Or will efforts at achieving peace be scuppered by those both inside and outside the country who would rather see the conflict remain frozen until one side takes all?\n\nTheo Kyriacou\n\nHarlow, Essex\n\nIn matters to do with war and what people think about it, we need to take account of what they are being told. With the exception of those who support the extremist right, and theocratic ideologies that champion violence and war as part of their creed, the vast majority of people abhor these primitive human traits. But if war is presented as a noble defence against the violence and aggression of an adversary, then people\u2019s abhorrence can be overcome.\n\nWith regard to the results of this survey of European citizens about Ukraine (Most Europeans want to stand with Kyiv against Moscow poll suggests, 9 February), Hermann Goering\u2019s ominous words, spoken to the US psychologist Gustave Gilbert in his cell at Nuremberg, are worth noting: \u201cNaturally, the common people don\u2019t want war, but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along \u2026 voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.\u201d\n\nRussell Caplan\n\nWood Green, London\n\nIt may help the tension over Russia\u2019s intentions in Ukraine if there were some acknowledgment among Nato members that there is some basis for Russian suspicion. Memories of the second world war are still very much alive in the country, and their losses in that conflict dwarfed those of other nations. In addition, large tracts of their country were ravaged. It is hardly surprising that there is an unease about having a hostile alliance formed along their border with the rest of Europe.\n\nJill Read\n\nGreenfield, Greater Manchester\n\nRegarding Emmanuel Macron and the \u201cpersonal assurances\u201d over the Russia-Ukraine crisis he has received from Vladimir Putin (Report, 8 February), didn\u2019t Neville Chamberlain obtain assurances \u2013 written, in his case \u2013 from Adolf Hitler about Germany invading Czechoslovakia back in 1938?

        "content": "The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will travel to Kyiv on Monday as western leaders voiced concerns of a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any moment, sending stock markets tumbling and the price of oil soaring.\n\nOn the eve of his departure, Scholz said that any Russia attack would lead to \u201ctough sanctions that we have carefully prepared and which we can immediately put into force\u201d.\n\n\u201c(These trips are) about how we can find a way to ensure peace in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nScholz and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy are expected to talk about how Germany could help stabilise Ukraine\u2019s economy after fears of an imminent war took a toll on its currency. A moratorium on Ukraine\u2019s eligibility for Nato accession was not on the table for Germany, a German source told Reuters, though Die Welt reported earlier a compromise whereby Russia would be assured that Ukraine would not join Nato \u201cin the next 10 years\u201d had been discussed in Scholz\u2019s circles as a \u201cthought experiment\u201d.\n\nUkraine\u2019s ambassador in London, Vadym Prystaiko, suggested to the BBC earlier that Kyiv \u201cmight\u201d consider shelving its Nato plans if \u201cpushed to it\u201d.\n\nThe prospect of a Russian invasion sent shares plunging when the trading week began in Asia on Monday morning. The Nikkei in Japan lost 2%, the Hong Kong market was off 1.2%, and futures trade pointed to more selling on European bourses when they open later in the day.\n\nThe price of Brent crude soared 1% to a seven-year high of $95.46 over worries that a conflict in the region could disrupt supplies from Russia, a major oil producer.\n\nOn Tuesday Scholz is expected to use a trip to Moscow to press home the economic cost of an invasion of Ukraine, German government sources have said.\n\nMeanwhile, Boris Johnson said he would hold further talks with world leaders to bring Russia \u201cback from the brink\u201d of war. His office did not say which world leaders Johnson was hoping to talk to or where he plans to travel, but it was understood he is keen to engage with Nordic and Baltic countries.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelenskiy urged Joe Biden to visit Kyiv \u201cin the coming days\u201d in a show of moral support. The White House made no mention of the invitation in its readout of the 50-minute call.\n\nA White House statement said Biden made clear the US would \u201crespond swiftly and decisively to any further Russian aggression\u201d and the two leaders agreed on the need to continue pursuing diplomacy and deterrence. Biden has already ordered a near-total evacuation of the US embassy in Kyiv.\n\nThe latest moves come amid a signals in the west that time is running out to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. US intelligence over the weekend claimed that Russia had accelerated plans for an invasion and could move troops across the border as soon as Wednesday, before the end of the Winter Olympics on 20 February.\n\nJake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, told the CBS News programme Face the Nation: \u201cWe have seen over the course of the past 10 days, dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces and the disposition of those forces in such a way that they could launch a military action essentially at any time.\n\n\u201cBut of course, it still awaits the go order. And so therefore, we cannot predict the precise date or time that they make any action.\u201d\n\nReflecting the West\u2019s concerns, Dutch airline KLM cancelled flights to Ukraine until further notice. The Ukrainian charter airline SkyUp said on Sunday its flight from Madeira, Portugal, to Kyiv was diverted to the Moldovan capital. And Ukraine\u2019s air traffic safety agency Ukraerorukh issued a statement declaring the airspace over the Black Sea to be a \u201czone of potential danger\u201d and recommended that planes avoid flying over the sea from 14 to 19 February.\n\nRussia denies it plans to invade Ukraine, but there were reports on Sunday of attack and troop-carrying helicopters being moved close to the Ukrainian border. Moscow failed to reply to a formal request from Ukraine to clarify the purpose of its military manoeuvres in Belarus by the 48-hour deadline set by the Vienna document, an international agreement intended to provide transparency and reduce the risk of war.\n\nThe Belarus government responded to a similar request from Baltic nations, but said that some of the Russian units on its territory were there to guard its southern border, suggesting they would not be leaving on 20 February, when the military exercises are supposed to end.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the \u201cnext step\u201d was requesting a meeting within the next 48 hours for \u201ctransparency\u201d about Russia\u2019s plans.\n\nA submarine armed with cruise missiles from Russia\u2019s Baltic fleet also sailed through the Bosphorus towards the Black Sea. Meanwhile, Lithuania announced a delivery of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine while the US embassy said a 17th planeload of US military hardware had arrived in Kyiv, including shoulder-fired grenades.\n\nGerman government circles on Sunday talked of a \u201cvery worrying overall picture\u201d on the Ukrainian border but rejected the suggestion that Scholz\u2019s trip represented a \u201clast attempt\u201d at averting a war.\n\nGerman government sources said Scholz would press home the \u201cunity of the EU, the US and Great Britain\u201d when it came to economic sanctions in response to an invasion. Biden has said a Russian invasion would spell the end of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, something Scholz has been more reluctant to spell out.\n\nScholz\u2019s options during his trip to Moscow are limited. The Russian president is demanding \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from the west, which would in effect undermine the sovereignty of independent states in east-central Europe and the Baltics.\n\nGerman government sources said on Sunday Scholz would offer Putin a dialogue and seek to find out more what Russia\u2019s grievances entailed. The broadsheet Die Welt said he could stress Ukraine joining Nato is not a realistic prospect in the near future, adding that a compromise whereby Russia would be assured that Ukraine would not join Nato \u201cin the next 10 years\u201d had been discussed in Scholz\u2019s circles as a \u201cthought experiment\u201d, though not as a concrete plan.\n\nUkraine has expressed an interest in joining since 2002 but it would require the unanimous approval of existing members, based on factors such as a functioning democracy and an absence of \u201cunresolved external territorial disputes\u201d.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Warnings from the US that Russian troops are poised to strike at Ukraine are growing more urgent and strident. There can be little doubt of the US\u2019s conviction that Ukraine is at imminent risk, and the number of nations advising citizens to leave the country as soon as possible shows that the warnings are at last being considered credible.\n\nBut the emphasis on near-inevitable war \u2013 and the naming of narrow timeframes when it is expected to happen \u2013 is also closing down options for the US and its allies, while opening them up for Russia. Moscow still has the initiative, and the risk is growing that its president, Vladimir Putin, is being set up to achieve a diplomatic victory through pulling the rug from under the western war scare.\n\nThere\u2019s been no shortage of speculation over how long Russia can keep its troops on the border without either launching an attack or withdrawing them. But back in November, when Putin first explained the purpose of Russia\u2019s threatening force buildup, he also said it was important for those forces to keep the pressure on \u201cfor as long as possible\u201d. Three months on, the question instead is how long the US and its closest allies can keep ratcheting up the warnings of imminent conflict.\n\nWhile previously it would have been hard to cast any retreat by Putin as anything but humiliating failure, it is now the US that stands to be embarrassed, and the credibility of its intelligence disclosures once again shattered, if Russia chooses an option other than invasion \u2013 or even simply continues to sit on the border as the dates named by the US come and go.\n\nThe continuing diplomatic procession to Moscow, meanwhile, brings little obvious benefit. For the most part it repeats arguments Russia has already rejected, and hears complaints from Moscow that are already wearily familiar. There is no indication that insistent cajoling by western leaders and ministers has had any influence on Russia\u2019s plans \u2013 even when the French president, Emmanuel Macron, apparently tried to negotiate with Russia by making sweeping promises on behalf of Ukraine and Nato.\n\nFor now, Russia is continuing to reap benefits from its military deployments. It\u2019s not just citizens and embassy staff that western countries are pulling out of Ukraine. Training missions by US, British and Canadian troops have also been withdrawn \u2013 with the specific aim of preventing them getting in the line of fire in the event of a Russian attack. This approach is the polar opposite of the way the west protects the Baltic states, where small contingents from multiple Nato member states are embedded in national militaries precisely to ensure that, in the event of Russian aggression, they are directly and immediately involved. That strategy has proved a striking success. Where in 2016 there was much public discussion of how the Baltic states were potential prime candidates for the next Russian intervention, some people now consider these three countries the safest they have been in centuries.\n\nIt\u2019s too late to take that approach with Ukraine. As the crisis unfolded, the US and UK almost immediately ruled out direct military support on the ground to Kyiv. Moscow will have been delighted, as once again the west helpfully took Russia\u2019s greatest fears off the table. The extent of support to Ukraine is supposedly limited by the fact that it isn\u2019t a member of Nato, but there\u2019s no shortage of precedents for western powers offering protection from aggression beyond the borders of the alliance. There\u2019s been startlingly little discussion of reducing Russia\u2019s options by declaring no-fly zones and maritime exclusion zones over and around Ukraine, and being visibly ready to enforce them \u2013 presenting Russia with the risk of direct clashes with Nato nations if it supports an attack by use of air or sea power.\n\nRussia is demanding the withdrawal of Nato from eastern Europe precisely because it presents a deterrent and a constraining factor on its ambitions. Military experts talk of Moscow employing a \u201ccompellence strategy\u201d to achieve this \u2013 a shorthand for Russia using the threat of force to extract sweeping concessions from the west like a street criminal. But the west is only a helpless victim of this mugging through its own choice.\n\nFive months ago, Chatham House published a survey of past successes and failures in dissuading Russia from aggression, titled What deters Russia. The case studies taken from incidents and confrontations over the decades show striking consistency: Russia achieves success when stronger adversaries back down in the face of threats, but retreats if those same adversaries demonstrate the will and determination to protect themselves, their allies or partners.\n\nRussia\u2019s network of propagandists, mouthpieces and influencers has been insistently pushing the idea that confronting Moscow risks almost inevitable escalation to nuclear war. That\u2019s obscured the fact that a clash with the US and its allies is the worst-case scenario for Russia, and the prospect is one of the few genuine deterrents for Putin. The possibility of western direct support for Ukraine carries a far more immediate, direct and palpable risk for Russia than repeated warnings of further sanctions. While warning of Russia\u2019s plans to attack, the US and its allies should also be letting Putin believe they might just do something about it.",

        "content": "New York CNN Business \u2014\n\nIf Russia invades Ukraine, global stock markets could be in for a rough ride \u2014 much worse than most other geopolitical events of the past several decades.\n\nA Russian invasion of Ukraine could further disrupt supplies of crude, potentially leading prices that are already their highest in seven years and approaching $100 a barrel, to even loftier levels.\n\n\u201cThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to push crude oil prices above $100 a barrel sooner than earlier projected,\u201d said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with AvaTrade, in a report Monday. \u201cThe potential jump in oil prices depends on what sort of sanctions the United States of America and its allies are likely to impose on Russia if it actually invades its neighbor.\u201d\n\nA spike in energy prices could hurt consumers and also prompt the Federal Reserve and other central banks to move more quickly to raise interest rates to try and tamp down inflation. That would probably be bad news for stocks as well.\n\nCapital Economics analysts wrote in a report Monday that \u201ca Russian invasion of Ukraine or severe ratcheting up of sanctions\u201d could add as much as 2 percentage points to inflation in developed markets\u2026\u201dparticularly in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the inflationary backdrop and hawkish signals from central banks, monetary policy could be tightened more aggressively as a result,\u201d the Capital Economics analysts added.\n\nMarket may ignore some scary headlines, but not when oil\u2019s involved\n\nThat\u2019s one of the main reasons the market probably wouldn\u2019t shrug off a conflict in Ukraine, even though it quickly dismissed many other skirmishes and terrorist attacks during the past century.\n\nCFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall analyzed the market reaction to 24 military and terrorist events since World War II.\n\nStovall found that the S&P 500 typically fell only about 1% on initial news of a military event or terror attack and just 5.5% over the length of a particular event. And it only took, on average, 52 days for stocks to recover their losses.\n\n\u201cThe equity markets are more at risk from the fallout from the war on inflation than on a potential invasion of Ukraine,\u201d Stovall wrote. \u201cHistory reminds investors that surprise military and terrorist activities have traditionally been short-lived and represented an attractive buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nMany of these events did not have a broader economic spillover, such as the assassination of President Kennedy, the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, the Madrid bombing of 2004, London terrorist attack in 2005 and the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013.\n\nBut another major military conflict on Stovall\u2019s list did impact the oil market: the 1990 war following the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq. And that led to a much greater market shock.\n\nThe S&P 500 plunged nearly 17% during the start of the Persian Gulf War, and it took more than half a year (189 days) for the market to recoup its losses.\n\nIt seems likely that a drawn-out conflict in Ukraine would be more problematic to the global markets and economy \u2014 much more like the Kuwait invasion than one-off terrorist events. Others worry about the fact that Russia is not just a significant player in the energy market.\n\n\u201cGiven that Russia is a major oil and grain supplier and is a key producer of palladium, used in catalytic converters, fears of price rises are very real,\u201d said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, in a report Monday.\n\nThe last thing that consumers (or investors) need is for more inflation pressure to push the costs of goods even higher.",

Truss has said it was not for Russia to determine Ukraine\u2019s security arrangements.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe big risk is if there is an invasion into Ukraine. That would be hugely damaging for Russia and Ukraine, and it would further undermine stability in Europe.\n\n0:59 Liz Truss 'very worried' about possible Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2013 video\n\n\u201cPresident Putin has actively questioned why other countries in eastern Europe are members of Nato as well, so this I fear would not stop at Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on the neighbouring states of Russia and other east European countries in trying to undermine the legitimacy of them being part of Nato.\u201d\n\nAsked to expand on this point, the foreign secretary said: \u201cIf we saw an invasion into Ukraine, there would be severe costs in terms of a long-running conflict. We could see the undermining of security more broadly in Europe, we could also see other aggressors around the world see it as an opportunity to expand their ambitions too so this is a very dangerous moment for the world.\u201d\n\nAsked to which other countries she was referring, Truss cited Iran and China as examples of potential aggressors.\n\nRussia has amassed at least 130,000 troops on the Ukrainian border and Truss said an invasion of the country \u201ccould be imminent and it is highly likely\u201d.\n\nShe said any conflict could be a \u201clong, protracted war\u201d. When asked on Times Radio whether Russia had the military capacity to take and hold all of Ukraine, Truss said: \u201cWhat we know is that the Ukrainians will fight. The UK has trained up 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve supplied defensive weapons as have other allies. So, this will not be easy or simple for Vladimir Putin. This could be a long, protracted war, which would, of course, create huge damage for both the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia as well as threatening European security.\u201d\n\nHowever, Truss said Putin could still \u201cchange his mind\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe know or we believe that Vladimir Putin has not yet made a decision about whether to invade Ukraine. We think it\u2019s highly likely.\n\n\u201cThere are huge numbers of troops lined up on the border. We know that they\u2019re in a position to attack imminently, but he can still change his mind and that is why diplomacy is so vital.\u201d",

You need to look deeper, at the root cause, namely Russia's seizing the initiative on regional, international security,\" he said referring, in particular, to Russia's written proposals on security guarantees. The minister believes that the proposals addressees could not ignore them, yet they could not accept them either. \"Therefore, by whipping up the hysteria, information terrorism, as Sergey Lavrov [Russian Foreign Minister] dubbed it, by taking specific actions, trying to keep the focus on the situation in Ukraine, the counterparties have been trying to downplay the Russian proposals on security guarantees, turn them null and void and show that Russia's real policy is far from the things that they propose,\" the Belarusian minister of foreign affairs said.\n\n\"What is happening now around Ukraine is artificially and purposefully created by the forces that do not want Russia to play a decisive, important role in security in the region and in the world as a whole. This is the eternal dispute about who is stronger, who is right, who is the number one power,\" Vladimir Makei summed up.",

        "content": "This article is an editorial, aiming to convey to the Western audiences, including journalists, what\u2019s on the mind of the Ukrainian people these days, why they have no fear, and what is the main motivation driving the nation\n\nIn the wide range of feelings experienced by Western journalists deployed in Ukraine in these troubled days is confusion. After all, Europe froze at the sound of Russian war drums. The feed keeps bringing alarming news on Russian tanks, artillery and Iskander missile systems amassed along the Ukrainian border. The U.S. State Department even announced a possible date of Russian invasion, while experienced Israel, along with a dozen other nations, is urgently evacuating diplomats from the country. Yet, there\u2019s no apparent war fear in Ukraine \u2013 much to everyone\u2019s surprise.\n\nAll institutions, government agencies, boutiques, beauty shops, and theaters continue to operate as usual. The country\u2019s capital Kyiv, along with other major cities, remains vibrant and lives a normal life with children going to school, businesses and offices remaining open to clients, no one taping their windows in anticipation of bombing or digging trenches in the suburbs to \u201cmeet\u201d Russian tanks.\n\nPeople keep their calm, running errands, while, of course, discussing the latest tensions over a coffee in a brasserie or in front of their TVs at home, watching instead of a football match a flow of worrying news: \u201cDe-escalation talks have failed,\u201d \u201cThe Russians pull fuel tanks and field hospitals closer to Ukraine\u2019s border,\u201d \u201cRussian invasion is imminent,\u201d and the like.\n\n\"I was at the Unity March (in Kyiv on Feb 12 - ed.) where I saw many Western journalists. They looked at us as if we\u2019re some aliens,\" a correspondent with one of Kyiv's major outlets shares her reflections on Facebook. In fact, there are now thousands of such posts across social media these days.\n\nIn fact, the topic of this calm seen in the Ukrainian people has become no less important in the Western media than Russia's military movements. Some western journalists perceive our population as \"fatalists,\" which is plain wrong. In fact, there is nothing \"heroic\", \"fatalistic\" or even unusual in such human behavior. The reason behind it is quite simple \u2013 Russia has been waging war against Ukraine for eight years already. These are the eight years of daily reports of deadly shelling, IDPs, and casualties among our military and civilians.\n\nThese are the eight years of hate, tonnes of information dirt and Russian malign narratives being shamelessly poured onto the Ukrainians from the Internet and local pro-Russian TV channels \u2013 generally unrestricted. After, all, this is the unfortunate downside of democracy and freedom of speech for which Ukrainians have fought for so long\u2026\n\nThese are the eight years of a rather superficial attitude on the part of the West to this largely \"forgotten\" war\u2026 \u201cWhere is Ukraine anyway?\u201d many in Europe and beyond must have been asking themselves, unwilling to get out of their comfort zone and stress out over a conflict they thought would never concern them almost directly...\n\nMeanwhile, our Western colleagues would mostly very kindly and patiently listen to our stories about this war as we were trying to convey to them a simple idea \u2013 what\u2019s happening in Ukraine is no internal conflict as Russia is trying to portray. This has nothing to do with internal civil confrontation, we would repeat again, and again. This is, in fact, a clash of worlds, with Ukraine defending up in arms the European values in which it chose to believe. And today, Ukrainians keep defending the very values that are now, unfortunately, being questioned and eroded in some European capitals.\n\nThe Ukrainian message, however, would often fall on deaf ears across Europe as some suggested that the western audiences might have hard time telling between the \u201ctwo sorts of propaganda,\u201d thus drawing parallel lines between Ukrainian reporting and Russian misinformation\u2026\n\nBefore our eyes, history proves the fallacy of this attitude. The latest moves by Russia are threatening a new major war on the European continent. This time, Russia\u2019s unequivocal threats are targeting more nations than just Ukraine. In fact, the Kremlin\u2019s ultimatum has addressed the entire West, demanding that they renounce the European values and the very foundations of European security on which the whole democratic world stands.\n\nAt the same time, in order to solidify their negotiating position and become more convincing, the Russians directed thousands of tank barrels toward their \u201cWestern partners\u201d and started waving their nuclear baton \u2013 perhaps the only argument left to use by this once great country, which is now going through yet another period of stagnation, being ruled for decades by the same authoritarian and kleptocratic regime.\n\nThe \"Great West\" seems to have noticed this Russian \"argument,\" realized the level of threat, and finally started to react. The emotional tsunami that has now swept across most Western media over Russia's belligerent preparations is very well known to Ukrainians as we observed the developments unfold in 2014, when a shocker came with the Russian \"little green men\" insidiously stabbing the \"fraternal nation\" in the back. After the Crimea grab, the Russians unleashed a brutal massacre in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas, employing tanks, howitzers, and anti-aircraft systems that the Russian propaganda pundits outrageously claimed were purchased in local \u201cgun shops\u201d and manned by local \u201cfarmers.\u201d\n\nSo this pretty much answers the question of where Ukrainians get this peace of mind in the face of the threat of \"imminent\" aggression. Our people have had their fair share of \u201cscare.\u201d The people of Ukraine had already lived through all that anxiety and fear now being experienced by many Europeans (more than half of whom are convinced that a new war in Europe is not only possible but also imminent). So what comes as a shock to Europeans today is something Ukrainians have gotten used to as the war here has been simmering for years.\n\nOleh Zadoianchuk\n\nOur Agency has been in the whirlpool of tragic events since the onset of this war. It took the life ouf our reporter Oleh Zadoianchuk, who joined the Army ranks on without hesitation. \"If I hide behind the monitor, someone else will be drafted,\" he said before being deployed to the east of the country. He died on the night of September 4, 2014, just a week after being sworn in. It\u2019s important to know that Oleh was killed in his unit\u2019s tent camp, which came under an unprovoked attack of the Russian Tornado MLR systems which insidiously fired from across the border. When killing Ukrainian soldiers, the Russians were well aware Ukraine would not return fire to the Russian territory\u2026\n\nUkrinform is just one of the many media families that lost their loved ones to this brutal war. Those of us who remained in the job just continued to do what they know best, often out there on the front line.\n\nSo we know exactly where this tranquility stems from. The war, which has been going on for so many years now, has affected almost every family. It changed the entire society. The notorious \"Russian world\" that came to the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea is precisely what has shaped in our minds a calm and firm conviction that we need to employ all means to fight for our own freedom, to the end. Ukraine will never return to the Russian stable.\n\nThat is why, instead of panicking, our engineers, teachers, retirees, students \u2013 almost all population strata \u2013 are getting enrolled in territorial defense units, which even raises some eyebrows at the draft stations where clerks say they have never done so much paperwork. This all clearly points to a simple truth: if Russian soldiers invade Ukraine again, they will have to walk through fire.\n\nAccording to the latest polls run, including with the participation of Western agencies, about 70 percent of Ukraine's population is ready to defend Ukraine, with about half of the male respondents saying they will take up arms to this end. There are currently nearly 350,000 combat-hardened military reservists, who are ready to return to their bases at the first call. Ukrainians are prepared.\n\nThis is all you need to know to understand what\u2019s happening in Ukraine at the moment. The people are calm because they have long made their choice. The country will fight for a certain set of vital values, which are as strong in Kyiv as they are in Brussels, Prague, or Washington.\n\nIt is important to remember that Ukrainians will fight Russian autocracy, whether the West hints at NATO or EU membership prospects or delicately waters them down. Anyway, the Ukrainians support their nation\u2019s accession to the said organizations, as reflected in the Constitution.\n\nAmid the pressing treat, even these pivotal ideas on bloc affiliations seem secondary. What Ukrainians are ready to fight for with one of the world\u2019s most powerful armies is for their opportunity to set their own path, for having this long-sought freedom of choice. It\u2019s for the freedom people want to enjoy in their own territory. It\u2019s that simple. Just imagine our people\u2019s motivation.\n\nRussians are also aware of how motivated the Ukrainians are. Operatives with their army\u2019s general staff are aware, and so are the average Russians who keep in touch with their Ukrainian relatives. There\u2019s no wavering in Ukraine. Rather than tremble, the Ukrainians stand united in the face of the threat. \"Ukraine will resist\" is now the most popular meme across social networks in Ukraine. Also, an important and reassuring message to the nation is being spread including through big boards: Ukraine\u2019s Army will keep you safe. 4.5.0. (a military code for \u201call\u2019s calm\u201d).\n\nSuch calm determination on the part of Ukraine is the main deterrent against the Kremlin. This isn\u2019t because the \"Kremlin elders\" changed their mind about Ukraine, forgetting about their hate \u2013 not at all. It\u2019s just that they start realizing that their incursion would lead to a full-blown failure for them, with thousands of KIAs, an ensuing domestic political crisis, and a popular uprising on their own soil against the senseless killing of Russians in the war of aggression. We believe the Russians will immediately realize what the war will lead to once active hostilities burst out. Ukraine will not surrender, and the Russians, as our former \"brothers,\" know exactly what this phrase means.\n\nWith the inevitable economic collapse under the pressure of \u201csanctions from hell\u201d that the West has assured Russia will face should it opt for a new round of aggression against Ukraine, a \u201cvictorious blitz,\u201d as some hawkish Kremlin minds imagine it, would turn into a catastrophe for Russia. This, in fact, would be the final episode of the historical drama \u201cThe Fall of the Empire.\u201d\n\nWe are grateful to our Western colleagues, especially to the informants. It is they, that is, you - news agencies, pass through an avalanche of information, and convey the most important things to people and entire nations. This is especially significant given the massive flow of manipulative reports and outrageous disinformation circulated by Russia's government-operated media platforms that have unfortunately taken a deep root in the international media space, reaching out to the widest audiences across the globe thanks to ridiculously extensive funding \u2013 something Ukraine just can't afford. It\u2019s only thanks to joint efforts with our western colleagues that we are able to debunk those many myths about Ukraine and the nature of the ongoing conflict and deliver the truth.\n\nIt is truly gratifying that at this critical moment, most of our foreign colleagues remain highly professional and restrained.\n\nThe thing is, the challenge we are facing is not about Ukraine, or rather, not only about Ukraine. Multiple signs prove that we are all dealing with a civilizational conflict, a clash between the democratic world with autocratic regimes, a struggle of light and dark, good and evil, if you wish Ukraine is only a small part of this much wider war theater. Since 2014, we had been trying to convey this assumption to Europe, albeit without much success. Now we have finally been heard. This gives us all hope for peace and our common future.\n\nAs for the war\u2026 Have no doubt. Ukraine will prevail. We won\u2019t fail you.",

We retreated to the international sidelines following World War I, and the League of Nations couldn\u2019t prevent a second world war without American leadership.\n\nMOSCOW LOOKS TO SEVER MINSK AGREEMENTS AS RUSSIA, UKRAINE CONFLICT PERSISTS\n\nThe second time, America chose right. We drew a hard line against Soviet expansion in the late 1940s, and the Allies defeated the Axis of Evil under American leadership.\n\nNow, America must once again choose engagement. We must once again draw a hard line against Russian expansion. This time, to prevent Ukraine from becoming the first domino in a potential resurgence of the Soviet Union.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s strategy of restraint, in the hope of not provoking Putin, hasn\u2019t worked. The U.S. doesn\u2019t need to fight in Ukraine to effectively deter Russia. But we can and must do more to help this democratic nation defend itself.\n\n\n\nThus far, President Biden hasn\u2019t done anything to put doubt in the mind of Putin.\n\nPresident Biden started with threatening sanctions against Russia. Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to craft sanctions in a way that maximizes pain for Putin\u2019s cronies while minimizing damage to ordinary Russians.\n\nThe British capital is sometimes referred to as \"Londongrad\" for a reason \u2013 too many Kremlin-linked elites operate outside Russia. That leaves those who already suffer enough under Putin\u2019s rule to deal with much of the aftereffects of standard sanctions.\n\n\n\nThe White House is smart to this reality. That\u2019s why President Biden most recently threatened the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline \u2013 the same one he inexplicably lifted sanctions on earlier this year. Still, it makes no difference to Putin.\n\n\n\nOf course, cancellation of the Russia-to-Germany pipeline is dependent on our friends in Berlin. And right now, frankly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is proving to be a weak link in a supposedly united NATO alliance \u2013 so much so that Germany\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. felt compelled to warn him that Washington was coming to regard Germany as an \"unreliable partner.\"\n\nGermany is dependent on Russian natural gas. Subsequently, we cannot depend on Scholz to commit his country to ending Nord Steam 2. Putin is well aware of that reality. This is not even to mention Russia\u2019s new $117.5 billion oil and gas deal with China. Now, with a secure economic lifeline to Beijing, Putin has everything he needs to defy the United States and the international community.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s least effective deterrence strategy has been the positioning of 3,000 U.S. troops in Poland, Germany, and Romania. This was a major physical movement, but it is moot for a simple reason: Putin has no immediate intention of threatening these nations. His present mission is the invasion of Ukraine, and we aren\u2019t doing enough to help them defend against Russia\u2019s aggression.\n\n\n\nBut while Putin may not fear troops, sanctions or President Biden, there is one clear path to deterrence: A well-armed, well-organized Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe strength and influence of world leaders \u2013 even autocrats such as Putin \u2013 comes from their citizens. The Russian people will accept Russian casualties as part of a military invasion. But the Russian people will not accept week after week of Russian soldiers returning home in body bags at the hands of Ukrainian insurgents.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian people want to be free. They do not want to be part of Russia, and, according to both human and open-source intelligence, they are willing to fight for that freedom.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s handling of this situation will have humanitarian and geopolitical effects worldwide. If Russia is allowed to swallow Ukraine, tens of thousands could die and even more will be forced to flee their home. And if America is once again perceived as weak \u2013 a consequence of President Biden\u2019s historically disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal \u2013 our adversaries will be further emboldened and our allies further skeptical.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAmerica cannot afford another major misstep on the international stage. President Biden must immediately state his intention to arm and support Ukrainian freedom fighters should Russia choose to invade.\n\n\n\nIt is undoubtedly late in the day, but there is still time to deter Putin.

        "content": "Joe Biden has said he is convinced that Vladimir Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine and target its capital, Kyiv, which he said would be a \u201ccatastrophic and needless war of choice\u201d. But the US president insisted that until the attack began \u201cdiplomacy is always a possibility\u201d.\n\nBiden spoke to the press late on Friday after consulting European and Canadian allies, on a day of fast-moving events in and around Ukraine that brought it closer to the brink of conflict.\n\nSatellite imagery showed new Russian military movements, with helicopters and tanks moving closer to the border in multiple sites around the Ukraine border.\n\nThe leaders of Russian-controlled breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk claimed to be under Ukrainian attack and ordered the mass evacuation of civilians. A gas pipeline in Luhansk caught fire after explosions late on Friday night. A second blast hit the city about 40 minutes later. Earlier in the day, a car bomb detonated in an empty lot in Donetsk.\n\nBiden said claims of a Ukrainian attack were a fabricated attempt at providing a pretext for an invasion.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no evidence for these assertions and it defies basic logic to believe the Ukrainians would choose this moment, with well over 150,000 troops arrayed on its borders, to escalate a years-long conflict,\u201d he said, adding that the Ukrainians had held their fire.\n\n\u201cThroughout these tense moments, the Ukrainian forces have shown great judgment, and I might add restraint,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey refuse to allow the Russians to bait them into war.\u201d\n\nBiden said he had come to the conclusion that the Russian leader was set on war.\n\n\u201cAs of this moment, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s made the decision,\u201d he said, explaining his confidence by saying: \u201cWe have a significant intelligence capability.\u201d\n\nBut Biden added that until an attack began, \u201cdiplomacy is always a possibility\u201d.\n\nHe confirmed that US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is due to hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, next Thursday, \u201cbut if Russia takes military action before that day, it will be clear that they have slammed the door shut on diplomacy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey will have chosen a war and they will pay a steep price for doing so,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMake no mistake, if Russia pursues its plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice.\u201d\n\nAfter the evacuation announcements in Donetsk and Luhansk, sirens went off in the cities of the region, supposedly to warn of an impending Ukrainian military assault. Reporters and independent monitors said there was no sign of a Ukrainian attack. Kyiv denied taking any hostile action and Ukrainian intelligence had earlier warned that infrastructure in the Russian-controlled regions had been mined to provide a pretext for a Russian offensive.\n\nThe metadata on the video evacuation orders by separatist Luhansk and Donetsk leaders showed they had been recorded two days earlier.\n\nUS officials increased its estimates of the force massed on Ukraine\u2019s border to 190,000 troops, arrayed in over 120 battalion tactical groups, representing the biggest mobilization of troops since the second world war. US officials said that about half of them had moved into attack positions.\n\nThe US image company Maxar said on Friday that new satellite images showed a large new deployment of helicopters in Belarus and a gathering of tanks and personnel carriers at Millerovo Airfield, 16 miles from the Ukraine border. More helicopters had arrived in Belgorod just to the north of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, and in Crimea.\n\nView image in fullscreen Satellite imagery provided by Maxar of Millerovo Airfield, 16 miles from the Ukraine border. Photograph: AP\n\nThe White House and the UK government said on Friday they believed that Russia was behind cyber attacks this week that temporarily shut down the websites of two of Ukraine\u2019s biggest banks and its ministry of defense.\n\nAnd in Moscow, it was announced that Putin would this weekend oversee a drill of nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is remotely contemplating using nuclear weapons,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut I do think he is focused on trying to convince the world that he has the ability to change the dynamics in Europe in a way that he cannot.\u201d\n\nAt a security conference in Munich, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the world had reached \u201cone of the most dangerous moments where provocation and disinformation might turn into escalation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat is at stake for the people of Ukraine is their right to determine their own future, and, for all of us, what is at stake is nothing less than peace in Europe and whether we are going to defend our rules-based order, even if it comes to a crunch.\u201d\n\nShe also warned the scale of violence had dramatically increased in the past 48 hours. The conflict was not a Ukraine crisis, she said, but \u201ca Russia crisis \u2026 Those who want to live together in safety do not threaten each other\u201d.\n\nBaerbock said she feared Russia would operate through a false-flag operation or a coup rather than invasion.\n\nSpeaking alongside Blinken, Baerbock vowed that Germany was \u201cwilling to pay a high price in economic terms\u201d through sanctions, adding that everything was on the table, including the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.\n\nEU foreign ministers will look at their expected sanctions package on Monday, but western officials said it may be necessary to hit Russia \u201cquickly and at scale\u201d in the event of a non-conventional attack on Ukraine. Sanctions could be implemented \u201cwhere we judge that Russia has crossed a line on this\u201d, the officials said.\n\nForeign ministers in Munich are likely to look at the threat of a major humanitarian crisis developing if refugees flee through Poland.\n\nThe US is nevertheless still hoping that Lavrov will hold talks on Russia and Nato\u2019s rival schemes for a future security map of Europe at the end of next week, possibly in Geneva.\n\nBlinken warned that everything he was seeing suggested Russia had decided not to embark on the path of diplomacy, and he feared the developments of the last 48 hours were probably part of a Russian plan to create false provocations.\n\nHe said he remained fully engaged with diplomacy, but the west had to be informed by history, including the Russian invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2008. \u201cWe have to be informed by the facts, and the facts are that despite what Russia has said in recent days about pulling back troops from the border, [that] has not happened. On the contrary, we see additional forces going to the border, including leading-edge forces that will be part of any aggression,\u201d he said.",

Pacek explains\n\nScholz: Russia made the issue of possible membership of Ukraine in NATO Casus Bella\n\nThe conference was started by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.- Russia made the issue of possible membership of Ukraine in NATO Casus Bella, which is a paradox because the decision is not planned in this matter - said Scholz.He noted, however, that the West is ready to negotiate on Russian security demands, but \"not being naive\".\n\nThe latest reports about the situation in Ukraine can be followed in live coverage HERE.\n\n- There is no justification for the assembly 100,000soldiers at the borders of Ukraine - the chancellor emphasized.In his opinion, Russia's military aggression against Ukraine will be a \"serious mistake with significant political, economic and geostrategic costs for her.\"\n\nKamala Harris: A commitment to art.5 NATO is holy.The US supports them\n\nThe US Vice President during her speech at the beginning thanked the European leaders for their commitment in a situation in Ukraine.- The borders of states should not be changed by force.Russia pretends to be innocent.He creates false pretexts for invasion.We see that he gathers strength before our eyes.Disinformation, lies and propaganda spread - she said.\n\n- obligation to art.5 NATO is holy.The US supports them - the politician added.\n\nAs she emphasized, although Russia claims that it is ready to talk, it narrows their path.\"Russia's actions contradict her words,\" she said.- If Russia continues to run the invasion of Ukraine, then the US with partners will impose significant and unprecedented economic costs on this country - she noted.\n\nHarris announced financial sanctions and control of Russia's exports.She emphasized that they would also hit those who support the Kremlin invasion.Finally, Kamala Harris marked US support for NATO's eastern flank.\n\nStoltenberg: The numbers of Russian troops at the border are being expanded\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during the Munich Safety Conference that he sent a message to the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergei \u0141awrowa with an appeal that Russia would get involved in Dialog with the Council of NATO.Stoltenberg also confirmed once again that the risk of conflict is still real.\n\n\"There are no signs of the withdrawal of Russian troops, their numbers at the border with Ukraine are being expanded,\" said Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen: The EU cannot rely on gas supplies from a country that threatens war\n\nIn her speech, the head of the EC warned Moscow that her thinking from the \"dark past\" could cost Russia a prosperous future.- The world has been looking at the greatest concentration of troops on European land since the darkest days of the Cold War - said the head of the EC at the Munich Security Conference.She added that the Kremlin is trying to undermine the entire security structure in Europe.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen emphasized that the European Union cannot depend to such a large extent on gas supplies on a country that threatens to unleash the war on the continent.She repeated that if Russia began the invasion, she would suffer serious consequences.\n\n\"The threat from Russia towards Ukraine can change all international order,\" she said.",

        "content": "After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Ukraine's border, Russia is ratcheting up pressure on its ex-Soviet neighbor, threatening to destabilize Europe and draw in the United States.\n\nRussia has been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of troops, equipment and artillery on the country's doorstep. The aggression has sparked warnings from US intelligence officials that a Russian invasion could be imminent.\n\nIn recent weeks, whirlwind diplomatic efforts to diffuse tensions failed to reach a conclusion.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied it is planning an assault, insisting instead that NATO support for Ukraine constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. An escalation in shelling in eastern Ukraine and a vehicle blast in separatist-held Donbas has heightened fears that Moscow could be stoking the violence to justify an invasion.\n\nThe escalation in the years-long conflict between Russia and Ukraine has triggered the greatest security crisis on the continent since the Cold War, raising the specter of a dangerous showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know.\n\nWhat has set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a \"hostile act.\" In interviews and speeches, he has emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In an article penned in July 2021, Putin underlined their shared history, describing Russians and Ukrainians as \"one people.\"\n\nUkrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions, like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against that notion. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement.\n\nRussia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nRead more here.",

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday sanctions on Russia should be made public before a possible invasion of Ukraine occurs, as tensions between western nations and Russia continue to intensify.\n\nZelensky told CNN\u2019s Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour in a one-on-one interview at the Munich Security Conference that he disagreed with the stance that sanctions should only be listed after a potential Russian invasion takes place.\n\n\u201cThe question of just making it public \u2026 just the list of sanctions, for them, for us, to know what will happen if they start the war \u2013 even that question does not have the support,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen and after our country will be fired at or after we will have no borders, or after we will have no economy \u2026 why would we need those sanctions then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a discussion some time ago with one of the leaders of one of the leading countries and we were talking about the sanctions policy \u2026 we had a different vision on how sanctions should applied when Russian aggression will happen,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cSo when you are asking, what can be done, well, lots of different things can be done. We can even provide you with a list. The most important is willingness.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t even disclose what will happen to whom if the war starts \u2026 I doubt it will be triggered after it happens,\u201d he added.\n\nThe security conference is taking place as the brewing conflict between Russia and Ukraine threatens to boil over and diplomatic efforts stall.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive satellite images show Putin's latest moves. Expert breaks down what they tell us 01:33 - Source: CNN\n\nRussia has been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of troops, equipment and artillery on the country\u2019s doorstep. The aggression has sparked warnings from US officials that a Russian invasion is imminent.\n\nWhen asked about a potential false flag pretext for war with Russia, Zelensky told Amanpour that \u201cany provocations are very dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the most complicated question is that in Crimea, in the temporary occupied territory of the Donbas along Ukraine and Russia, there is 30 to 35,000 on the temporary occupying territories \u2026 so provocations are, indeed, very dangerous, if you have this number of troops. One shelling, one cannon fire can lead to war,\u201d Zelensky warned.\n\n\u201cThis is what our partners believe, I mean the partners that are around us that have joined borders with us. We know the history of the Soviet Union and they do understand the kind of risks we are facing. Poland, the Baltic states, Lithuania and Estonia, Latvia, Moldova \u2013 they know what that could lead to. So, we need to be very careful,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe went on to say casualties between Ukraine and Russia were more significant in 2014 but admitted that current tensions are \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201ca tragedy for our nation, for our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the tragedy for Russians as well who used to have good relations with Ukraine,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Ukrainian President told CNN that NATO partners needed to clarify a timeline on which the country could join the military alliance.\n\n\u201cUkraine needs security guarantees,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe are smart people, we are not narrow minded. We understand there are lots of different risks because of NATO, there is no consensus around other allies, everyone is saying there is some distance that we need to go between Ukraine and NATO that we need to walk. All we are saying is tell us how much time does it take to complete this distance?\u201d\n\nIn earlier remarks to the conference, Zelensky posed a question asking why Ukraine had not been permitted to join NATO. \u201cWe are told the doors are open.. but the strangers are still not allowed,\u201d he said.\n\nMoscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO \u2013 in terms of weaponry, training and personnel \u2013 as a threat to its own security. Putin has also called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia\u2019s borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.\n\nAmanpour also asked Zelensky about the aggressive use of US intelligence to dissuade Putin from invading Ukraine. He said he was \u201cgrateful for the work that both of our intelligence has been doing. But the intelligence I trust is my intelligence.\n\n\u201cI trust Ukrainian intelligence who \u2026 understand what\u2019s going on along our borders, who have different intelligence sources and understand different risk based on intercepted data\u2026 this information should be used.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are not really living in delusion. We understand what can happen tomorrow \u2026 just putting ourselves in coffins and waiting for foreign soldiers to come in is not something we are prepared to do.\u201d\n\nZelensky then called for international partners to support Ukraine by investing in the country. \u201cStrengthen our arms\u2026 our economy. Invest in our country. Bring your business in.\n\n\u201cWe are not panicking, we want to live our lives,\u201d he added.\n\nZelensky also explained that his attendance at the conference on Saturday was to ensure there was a Ukrainian voice was in the room. \u201cI\u2019m the president, it\u2019s important for all our partners and friends to not agree about anything behind our back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not panicking, we\u2019re very consistent that we are not responding to any provocations.\u201d\n\nHis appearance in Germany had been under intense scrutiny after it was revealed that Biden administration officials had privately urged the Ukrainian leader to remain at home amid concerns of a possible Russian incursion, according to three US officials and one senior Ukrainian official.\n\nSome US officials were concerned that Zelensky\u2019s absence from Ukraine could open the door for Russia to make false claims that he has fled.\n\nHowever, the president\u2019s office confirmed earlier Saturday he would attend the conference and meet US Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson before returning to Kyiv later the same day.\n\nHours before the sit-down with Amanpour, Zelensky met with Harris, telling her he was grateful for US support, particularly in bolstering Ukraine\u2019s defense capacity.\n\n\u201cThis is our land and the only thing we want is to have peace, bring the peace back to our country,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nIn the bilateral meeting which lasted roughly 45 minutes, Harris told the Ukrainian leader that the US \u201ctakes seriously the importance of the integrity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine and your sovereignty, and the United States stands with Ukraine in this regard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny threats to your country we take seriously, and we have rallied our allies and our partners to speak with one voice,\u201d the vice president said.\n\nHarris said she wanted to hear directly from Zelensky about his concerns and the developing situation on the ground and would share with him information the US has about the current crisis.\n\n\u201cAs you know, this is a decisive moment in our world history,\u201d Harris told Zelensky.",

        "content": "Full text of Zelensky's speech at Munich Security Conference Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world says it doesn't want to fight, and Russia says it doesn't want to attack. One of us is lying. It is not an axiom yet, though not a hypothesis already\n\nLadies and Gentlemen! Two days ago I was in Donbas, on the demarcation line. De jure \u2013 between Ukraine and the temporarily occupied territory. De facto \u2013 the demarcation between peace and war. There is a kindergarten on one side, and a shell that hits it from the other. There is a school on one side, and a shell that hits the schoolyard from the other. And there are 30 children standing nearby. There are going to lessons, not to NATO.\n\nSomeone has a physics lesson. Knowing its basic laws, even children understand the absurdity of statements about the attacks launched from Ukraine.\n\nSomeone has a math lesson. Children without a calculator can figure out the difference between the number of shellings over these three days and mentions of Ukraine in this year's Munich Security Report.\n\nAnd someone has a history lesson. Seeing a shell crater in the schoolyard, children have a question: has the world forgotten its mistakes of the 20th century?\n\nWhat do appeasement attempts lead to? As the question \"Why die for Danzig?\" turned into the need to die for Dunkirk and dozens of other cities in Europe and the world. At the cost of tens of millions of lives.\n\nPhoto: EPA-EFE\n\nThese are horrible history lessons. I just want to make sure that we read the same books. So we equally understand the answer to the main question: How did it happen that there the war is ongoing and people are dying in Europe in the 21st century? Why does it last longer than World War II? How did we get to the biggest security crisis since the Cold War?\n\nFor me, the President of the country, which has lost part of its territory, thousands of people and now sees 150,000 Russian troops, equipment, and heavy weapons stationed near its borders, so for me, the answer is obvious.\n\nThe world security architecture is fragile. It needs an update. The rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work. They do not keep up with new threats. They are ineffective for overcoming them. It is like taking some cough syrup when you need a COVID-19 vaccine. The security system is slow. It falters again. Because of selfishness, self-confidence, irresponsibility of countries at the global level. As a result, some commit crimes, and others stay indifferent. Indifference that results in complicity. It is symbolic that I am talking about this right here. Fifteen years ago, it was here that Russia announced its intention to defy global security. What was the world\u2019s response? Reconciliation. What was the result? At the very least, the annexation of Crimea and aggression against my country.\n\nThe UN, which is supposed to defend peace and world security, cannot defend itself. When its Charter is violated. When one of the UN Security Council members annexes the territory of one of the founding members of the UN. Meanwhile, the UN itself ignores the Crimea Platform, the goal of which is to de-occupy Crimea peacefully and protect the rights of residents of Crimea.\n\nThree years ago, it was here that Angela Merkel said: \"Who will pick up the pieces of the world order? Only all of us together!\" The audience gave a standing ovation. But, unfortunately, the collective applause did not grow into collective action. And now, when the world is talking about the threat of a great war, the question arises: is there anything left to pick up? The security architecture in Europe and the world is almost destroyed. It's too late to think about repairs. It's time to build a new system.\n\nMankind has done this twice, paying too high a price \u2013 two world wars. We have a chance to break this trend until it becomes a regularity. And start to build a new system BEFORE we have millions of victims. Having the old lessons of the First and Second World Wars, not a first-hand experience of a possible third one.\n\nPhoto: President's Office\n\nI talked about it here. And at the UN as well. I said that there is no such thing as a foreign war in the 21st century. That the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas is a blow to the whole world.\n\nAnd this is not a war in Ukraine, but a war in Europe. I said that at summits and forums.\n\nIn 2019. In 2020. In 2021. Has the world finally heard that in 2022?\n\nIt is not an axiom yet, though not a hypothesis already. Why? Evidence is needed. Evidence harder than words on Twitter or statements in the media. Actions are needed. The world needs them, not we.\n\nWe will defend our land. Having support from partners or not. Having been given hundreds of modern weapons or 5,000 helmets. We appreciate any help, but everyone should understand that these are NOT charitable contributions which Ukraine should ask for or remind about. Not fine gestures which Ukraine should bow low for. This is your contribution to the security of Europe and the world. And Ukraine has been a shield for eight years. For eight years, it has been holding back one of the largest armies in the world. This army stands along our borders, not those of the EU. And the GRAD missiles were fired on Mariupol, not European cities. And after almost six-month fighting, the airport in Donetsk, not in Frankfurt, was destroyed. And it's always hot in the industrial area of Avdiivka, not in Montmartre. And no European country knows what it is like to hold military funerals in all regions every day. And no European leader knows what it is like to hold regular meetings with the families of the killed ones.\n\nBe that as it may, we will defend our land. No matter how many \u2013 50,000, 150,000 or 1 million \u2013 soldiers of any army are deployed on the border. To really help Ukraine, you don't need to say how many of them are there. You need to say how many of us are here.\n\nTo really help Ukraine, you don't have to constantly talk about the dates of a possible invasion. We will defend our land on February 16, March 1, and December 31. We need other dates much more.\n\nAnd everyone understands perfectly well which dates I am talking about. Tomorrow Ukraine marks the Day of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred.\n\nEight years ago, Ukrainians made their choice, many gave their lives for it. Eight years later, should Ukraine constantly call for the recognition of European prospects? Since 2014, the Russian Federation has been convincing us that we have chosen the wrong path, that no one is waiting for us in Europe. Shouldn't Europe constantly say and prove by action that this is not true? Shouldn't the EU say today that their citizens are positive about Ukraine's accession to the union? Why do we avoid this question? Doesn't Ukraine deserve direct and honest answers?\n\nThe same goes for NATO. We are told that the door is open. But so far: authorized access only. If not all members of the Alliance want to see us or all members of the Alliance do not want to see us, be honest about it. Open doors are good, but we need open answers, not questions closed for years. Isn't the right to the truth one of our enhanced opportunities? The next summit in Madrid is the best time for truth.\n\nRussia says Ukraine seeks to join the Alliance to regain Crimea by force. It is good that the words \"regain Crimea\" appear in their rhetoric. But they misread Article 5 of NATO's charter: collective action is for protection, not attack. Ukraine will certainly regain Crimea and the occupied areas of Donbas but by peaceful means only.\n\nPhoto:EPA-EFE\n\nWe consistently implement the Minsk and Normandy format agreements. They are underpinned with unquestionable recognition of the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. We seek a diplomatic settlement of the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict. I emphasize: solely on the basis of international law. I will never even think about the forceful way to regain the temporarily occupied territories. What is really happening in the peace process? Two years ago, we agreed on a full-scale ceasefire with the presidents of France, Russia and the German Chancellor. Ukraine adheres to it despite constant provocations from the other side. We are constantly putting forward new proposals within the framework of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. What do we see in response? Shells and bullets. Our soldiers and civilians are being killed and wounded, civilian infrastructure is being destroyed.\n\nThe last two days are especially telling. Massive attacks with the use of weapons prohibited under the Minsk agreements. OSCE's access to Ukraine's temporarily occupied territories remains restricted.\n\nThey are threatened. They are intimidated. All humanitarian issues are blocked.\n\nTwo years ago, I signed a law on the unconditional access for representatives of humanitarian organizations to detainees. But they are denied entry to the temporarily occupied territories. Russia blocked the process after two prisoner swaps, although Ukraine submitted agreed lists. Torture at the infamous Izolyatsia Prison in Donetsk became a symbol of human rights abuses.\n\nThe two new entry-exit checkpoints we opened in Luhansk region in November 2020 have not started working \u2013 and here we see an outright obstruction under contrived pretexts. Ukraine is doing everything possible to push forward the discussion of political issues. For a year and a half, our draft laws on peculiarities of local self-government and prevention of persecution of persons in connection with the events in certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions have been shelved at the TCG. And we see that Russia is reluctant to conduct a dialogue. Yesterday and today, Ukraine insists on holding the TCG meeting. Yesterday and today, Russia refuses to hold it. We demand that the negotiation process be unblocked immediately. In particular, within the Normandy format.\n\nHowever, it does not mean that the search for peace is limited to these formats alone.\n\nWe are ready to look for the key to the end of the war in all possible formats and platforms. Paris, Berlin, Minsk. Istanbul, Geneva, Brussels, New York, or Beijing \u2013 it does not matter where we will agree on peace in Ukraine. It does not matter whether the talks are held with the participation of four countries, seven, or a hundred. The main thing is that Ukraine and Russia are among them. What is really important is the understanding that not only we need peace. The world needs peace in Ukraine. Peace and restoration of integrity within internationally recognized borders.\n\nAnd only so and in no other way. And I hope no one thinks of Ukraine as a convenient and eternal buffer between the West and Russia, new Munich 2.0. This will not happen, no one will allow it. Otherwise \u2013 who's next? Will NATO countries have to defend each other? I want to believe that the North Atlantic Treaty and Article 5 will be more effective than the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nUkraine received security guarantees for abandoning the world's third nuclear capability. We do not have those weapons. Nor do we have security. Nor do we have a part of the territory that is larger than Switzerland, the Netherlands, or Belgium.\n\nNor do we have millions of our citizens what is most important. We do not have all this. But there is something we have. We have the right. The right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to guarantees of security and peace.\n\nSince 2014, Ukraine has made three attempts to convene consultations with the guarantor states of the Budapest Memorandum. Three attempts failed. Today Ukraine will make the fourth attempt. And I will make my first attempt as the President.\n\nBut both Ukraine and I are doing this for the last time. I initiate consultations within the framework of the Budapest Memorandum. The Minister of Foreign Affairs was instructed to convene them. If they do not take place again or they do not result in concrete decisions to ensure the security of our state, Ukraine will have every right to believe that the Budapest Memorandum is not working and all the 1994 package decisions have been called into question.\n\nI also suggest convening a summit of permanent members of the UN Security Council in the coming weeks, with the participation of Ukraine, Germany, and Turkey.\n\nTo address security challenges in Europe. And to draft new, effective security guarantees for Ukraine. Guarantees today, while we are not a member of the defense alliance. And, in fact, we are in a gray area \u2013 a security vacuum.\n\nPhoto: President's Office\n\nWhat else can we do now? To continue to provide efficient support to Ukraine and its defense capabilities. To provide a clear European prospect, support instruments available to candidate countries, clear and comprehensive timeframe for joining the Alliance. To support the transformation in our country. To create a Sustainability and Recovery Fund for Ukraine and the lend-lease program for supplying advanced weapons and equipment to our army.\n\nTo draft an effective package of preventive sanctions to deter the Russian Federation. To guarantee Ukraine's energy security, ensure its integration into the EU energy market, while Nord Stream 2 is used as a weapon.\n\nAll these questions need answers. And as long as there is silence instead, there will be no silence at the front. In the east of Ukraine. That is, in Europe. That is, all over the world. I hope that Europe and the whole world finally understand this.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen! I thank all the countries that have supported Ukraine.\n\nWith words, declarations, concrete help. I thank all those who stand with us today. Stand with truth and international law. I'm not calling you by name as I don't want some other countries to be ashamed. But it is their choice. Their karma. They have it on their conscience. However, I do not know how they will be able to explain their actions to the two soldiers killed and three soldiers wounded in Ukraine today. And most importantly \u2013 to three girls from Kyiv. One is 10 years old, another is 6, and the third one is only a year old. Today they lost their father. At 06:00 Central European Time.\n\nWhen a Ukrainian intelligence officer, Captain Anton Sydorov, died in the artillery fire, prohibited by the Minsk agreements. I don't know what he was thinking about at the last moment of his life. He certainly didn't know what agenda someone needed to meet to end the war. But he knows exactly the answer to the question I put at the beginning.\n\nHe knows for sure \u2013 WHICH ONE OF US IS LYING?\n\nMay he rest in peace. May all those killed today and during the war rest in peace.\n\nMay all those who do not want to stop this war burn in hell.\n\nMay the glory of all those who fight and continue to fight for peace and freedom be eternal!\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nCover photo: President\u2019s Office",

Whether they give us hundreds of modern weapons or five thousand helmets. We appreciate any help, but everyone should understand that these are not charitable contributions that Ukraine should ask for or remind of,\u201d the Ukrainian leader stressed.\n\n\u201cThese are not noble gestures for which Ukraine should bow low. This is your contribution to the security of Europe and the world. Where Ukraine has been a reliable shield for eight years. And for eight years it has been rebuffing one of the world\u2019s biggest armies. Which stands along our borders, not the borders of the EU.,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is the full text of his statement before international leaders and the world\u2019s press.\n\nSpeech by the President of Ukraine at the 58th Munich Security Conference\n\n19 February 2022\n\nUkraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world says it doesn\u2019t want to fight, and Russia says it doesn\u2019t want to attack. Someone is lying. This is not an axiom, but it is no longer a hypothesis.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen!\n\nTwo days ago I was in Donbas, on the delimitation line. Legally \u2013 between Ukraine and the temporarily occupied territories. In fact, the delimitation line between peace and war. Where on the one side there is a kindergarten, and on the other side there is a projectile that hit it. On the one side there is a school, on the other side there is a projectile hitting the school yard.\n\nAnd next to it there are 30 children who go\u2026 no, not to NATO, but to school. Someone has physics classes. Knowing its basic laws, even children understand how absurd the statements that the shelling is carried out by Ukraine sound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone has math classes. Children can calculate the difference between the number of shelling occasions in these three days and the occasions of mentioning Ukraine in this year\u2019s Munich Security Report without a calculator.\n\nAnd someone has history classes. And when a bomb crater appears in the school yard, children have a question: has the world forgotten its mistakes of the XX century?\n\nWhat do attempts at appeasement lead to? As the question \u201cWhy die for Danzig?\u201d turned into the need to die for Dunkirk and dozens of other cities in Europe and the world. At the cost of tens of millions of lives.\n\nThese are terrible lessons of history. I just want to make sure you and I read the same books. Hence, we have the same understanding of the answer to the main question: how did it happen that in the XXI century, Europe is at war again and people are dying? Why does it last longer than World War II? How did we get to the biggest security crisis since the Cold War? For me, as the President of a country that has lost part of the territory, thousands of people and on whose borders there are now 150,000 Russian troops, equipment and heavy weapons, the answer is obvious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe architecture of world security is fragile and needs to be updated. The rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work. They do not keep up with new threats. They are not effective for overcoming them. This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine. The security system is slow. It crashes again. Because of different things: selfishness, self-confidence, irresponsibility of states at the global level. As a result, we have crimes of some and indifference of others. Indifference that makes you an accomplice. It is symbolic that I am talking about this right here. It was here 15 years ago that Russia announced its intention to challenge global security. What did the world say? Appeasement. Result? At least \u2013 the annexation of Crimea and aggression against my state.\n\nThe UN, which is supposed to defend peace and world security, cannot defend itself. When its Charter is violated. When one of the members of the UN Security Council annexes the territory of one of the founding members of the UN. And the UN itself ignores the Crimea Platform, the goal of which is to de-occupy Crimea peacefully and protect the rights of Crimeans.\n\nThree years ago, it was here that Angela Merkel said: \u201cWho will pick up the wreckage of the world order? Only all of us, together.\u201d The audience gave a standing ovation. But, unfortunately, the collective applause did not grow into collective action. And now, when the world is talking about the threat of a great war, the question arises: is there anything left to pick up? The security architecture in Europe and the world is almost destroyed. It\u2019s too late to think about repairs, it\u2019s time to build a new system. Mankind has done this twice, paying too high a price \u2013 two world wars. We have a chance to break this trend until it becomes a consistent pattern. And start building a new system before millions of victims. Having the old lessons of the First and Second World Wars, not our own experience of the possible third, God forbid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI talked about it here. And on the rostrum of the UN. That in the XXI century there are no more foreign wars. That the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas affects the whole world. And this is not a war in Ukraine, but a war in Europe. I said this at summits and forums. In 2019, 2020, 2021. Will the world be able to hear me in 2022?\n\nThis is no longer a hypothesis, but not an axiom yet. Why? Evidence is needed. More important than words on Twitter or statements in the media. Action is required. It is the world that needs it, not just us.\n\nWe will defend our land with or without the support of partners. Whether they give us hundreds of modern weapons or five thousand helmets. We appreciate any help, but everyone should understand that these are not charitable contributions that Ukraine should ask for or remind of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are not noble gestures for which Ukraine should bow low. This is your contribution to the security of Europe and the world. Where Ukraine has been a reliable shield for eight years. And for eight years it has been rebuffing one of the world\u2019s biggest armies. Which stands along our borders, not the borders of the EU.\n\nAnd Grad rockets hit Mariupol, not European cities. And after almost six months of fighting, the airport in Donetsk was destroyed, not in Frankfurt. And it\u2019s always hot in the Avdiivka industrial zone \u2013 it was hot there in the last days, not in Montmartre. And no European country knows what military burials every day in all regions are. And no European leader knows what regular meetings with the families of the deceased are.\n\nBe that as it may, we will defend our beautiful land no matter if we have 50,000, 150 or one million soldiers of any army on the border. To really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to say how many servicemen and military equipment are on the border. Say what numbers we have.\n\nTo really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to constantly talk only about the dates of the probable invasion. We will defend our land on February 16, March 1 and December 31. We need other dates much more. And everyone understands perfectly well which ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTomorrow in Ukraine is the Day of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. Eight years ago, Ukrainians made their choice, and many gave their lives for that choice. Eight years later, should Ukraine constantly call for recognition of the European perspective? Since 2014, Russia has been convincing that we have chosen the wrong path, that no one is waiting for us in Europe. Shouldn\u2019t Europe constantly say and prove by action that this is not true? Shouldn\u2019t the EU say today that its citizens are positive about Ukraine\u2019s accession to the Union? Why do we avoid this question? Doesn\u2019t Ukraine deserve direct and honest answers?\n\nThis also applies to NATO. We are told: the door is open. But so far authorized access only. If not all members of the Alliance want to see us or all members of the Alliance do not want to see us, be honest. Open doors are good, but we need open answers, not open questions for years. Isn\u2019t the right to the truth one of our enhanced opportunities? The best time for it is the next summit in Madrid.\n\nRussia says Ukraine seeks to join the Alliance to return Crimea by force. It is gratifying that the words \u201creturn Crimea\u201d appear in their rhetoric. But they inattentively read Article 5 of the NATO Charter: collective action is for protection, not offensive. Crimea and the occupied regions of Donbas will certainly return to Ukraine, but only peacefully.\n\nUkraine consistently implements the Normandy agreements and the Minsk agreements. Their foundation is the unquestionable recognition of the territorial integrity and independence of our state. We seek a diplomatic settlement of the armed conflict. Note: solely on the basis of international law.\n\nSo what is really going on in the peace process? Two years ago, we agreed with the Presidents of France, the Russian Federation, the Chancellor of Germany on a full-scale ceasefire. And Ukraine is scrupulously adhering to these agreements. We are as restrained as possible against the background of constant provocations. We are constantly making proposals in the framework of the Normandy Four and the Trilateral Contact Group. And what do we see? Shells and bullets from the other side. Our soldiers and civilians are being killed and wounded, and civilian infrastructure is being destroyed.\n\nThe last days have become especially illustrative. Hundreds of massive shelling occasions with weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements. It is also important to stop restricting the admission of OSCE observers to Ukraine\u2019s TOT. They are threatened. They are intimidated. All humanitarian issues are blocked.\n\nTwo years ago, I signed a law on the unconditional admission of representatives of humanitarian organizations to detainees. But they are simply not admitted to the temporarily occupied territories. After two exchanges of captives, the process was blocked, although Ukraine provided agreed lists. Inhuman torture at the infamous Isolation Prison in Donetsk has become a symbol of human rights abuses.\n\nThe two new checkpoints we opened in November 2020 in the Luhansk region still do not function \u2013 and here we see outright obstruction under contrived pretexts.\n\nUkraine is doing everything possible to reach progress in discussions and political issues. In the TCG, in the Minsk process, we\u2019ve put forward proposals \u2013 draft laws, but everything is blocked \u2013 no one talks about them. Ukraine demands to unblock the negotiation process immediately. But this does not mean that the search for peace is limited to it alone.\n\nWe are ready to look for the key to the end of the war in all possible formats and platforms: Paris, Berlin, Minsk. Istanbul, Geneva, Brussels, New York, Beijing \u2013 I don\u2019t care where in the world to negotiate peace in Ukraine.\n\nIt does not matter if four countries, seven or a hundred participate, the main thing is that Ukraine and Russia are among them. What is really important is the understanding that peace is needed not only by us, the world needs peace in Ukraine. Peace and restoration of territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. This is the only way. And I hope no one thinks of Ukraine as a convenient and eternal buffer zone between the West and Russia. This will never happen. Nobody will allow that.\n\nOtherwise \u2013 who\u2019s next? Will NATO countries have to defend each other? I want to believe that the North Atlantic Treaty and Article 5 will be more effective than the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nUkraine has received security guarantees for abandoning the world\u2019s third nuclear capability. We don\u2019t have that weapon. We also have no security. We also do not have part of the territory of our state that is larger in area than Switzerland, the Netherlands or Belgium. And most importantly \u2013 we don\u2019t have millions of our citizens. We don\u2019t have all this.\n\nTherefore, we have something. The right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees.\n\nSince 2014, Ukraine has tried three times to convene consultations with the guarantor states of the Budapest Memorandum. Three times without success. Today Ukraine will do it for the fourth time. I, as President, will do this for the first time. But both Ukraine and I are doing this for the last time. I am initiating consultations in the framework of the Budapest Memorandum. The Minister of Foreign Affairs was commissioned to convene them. If they do not happen again or their results do not guarantee security for our country, Ukraine will have every right to believe that the Budapest Memorandum is not working and all the package decisions of 1994 are in doubt.\n\nI also propose to convene a summit of permanent members of the UN Security Council in the coming weeks with the participation of Ukraine, Germany and Turkey in order to address security challenges in Europe. And elaborate new, effective security guarantees for Ukraine. Guarantees today, as long as we are not a member of the Alliance and in fact are in the gray zone \u2013 in a security vacuum.\n\nWhat else can we do now? Continue to effectively support Ukraine and its defense capabilities. Provide Ukraine with a clear European perspective, the tools of support available to candidate countries, and clear and comprehensive timeframes for joining the Alliance.\n\nSupport the transformation in our country. Establish a Stability and Reconstruction Fund for Ukraine, a land-lease program, the supply of the latest weapons, machinery and equipment for our army \u2013 an army that protects the whole of Europe.\n\nDevelop an effective package of preventive sanctions to deter aggression. Guarantee Ukraine\u2019s energy security, ensure its integration into the EU energy market when Nord Stream 2 is used as a weapon.\n\nAll these questions need answers.\n\nSo far we have silence instead of them. And as long as there is silence, there will be no silence in the east of our state. That is \u2013 in Europe. That is \u2013 in the whole world. I hope the whole world finally understands this, Europe understands.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen!\n\nI thank all the states that supported Ukraine today.\n\nIn words, in declarations, in concrete help. Those who are on our side today. On the side of truth and international law. I\u2019m not calling you by name \u2013 I don\u2019t want some other countries to be ashamed. But this is their business, this is their karma. And this is on their conscience. However, I do not know how they will be able to explain their actions to the two soldiers killed and three wounded in Ukraine today.\n\nAnd most importantly \u2013 to three girls from Kyiv. One is ten years old, the second is six, and the third is only one. Today they were left without a father. At 6 o\u2019clock in the morning Central European Time. When the Ukrainian intelligence officer, Captain Anton Sydorov was killed as a result of artillery fire prohibited by the Minsk agreements. I don\u2019t know what he thought at the last moment of his life. He definitely didn\u2019t know what agenda someone needs to meet to end the war.\n\nBut he knows exactly the answer to the question I asked at the beginning. He knows exactly who of us is lying.\n\nMay his memory live forever. May the memory of all those who died today and during the war in the east of our state live forever.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Since 2014, Russia's aggression in Ukraine has claimed about 14,000 lives.\n\n\u201c8 years ago, the Russian Federation launched an armed invasion into the sovereign territory of Ukraine - the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. Russian aggression against Ukraine continued in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and in the Kerch Strait,\u201d reads the Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on 8 years since the beginning of Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine.\n\nAs the Ministry notes, the armed conflict waged by Russia has claimed the lives of about 14,000 people, injured at least 30,000, including civilians, and forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes in Crimea and Donbas to escape occupation for the government-controlled territory of Ukraine since 2014.\n\n\u201cThe first attempt to seize part of the territory of a neighboring state by force since World War II was a blow to world security, based on international law, including on respect for the internationally recognized borders of sovereign states. The temporary occupation and attempted annexation of Ukrainian territories turned them into zones of unprecedented violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. All those who disagree with the occupation are systematically persecuted. Russia oppresses Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar communities on ethnic and religious grounds in the temporarily occupied Crimea,\u201d reads the statement.\n\nIt is underscored that despite all the efforts of Ukraine and the international community to peacefully resolve the conflict created by Russia, Russia's aggression is only expanding.\n\n\u201cThe recent unprecedented military build-up by Russia near Ukraine's border, in the temporarily occupied Crimea and in Belarus became not only part of the pressure on Ukraine, but also an element of blackmail aimed at further undermining Europe's security architecture, norms and principles of international law,\u201d the MFA emphasizes.\n\n\u201cRussia continues to use all possible instruments of its ongoing aggression against Ukraine. Under the pretext of naval exercises, the Russian Federation is blocking large parts of the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Kerch Strait, closing safe and established routes of maritime trade leading to Ukrainian ports. The latest example of such behaviour was the blocking on 13-19 February,\u201d the diplomats note.\n\nMoreover, periodic attacks in cyberspace continue.\n\n\u201cThe aggressor state failed to achieve its key goal - to destroy the unity of Ukraine and undermine the steadfastness of the international coalition in support of Ukraine. We remain committed to resolving this armed conflict through political and diplomatic means within the framework of existing negotiation formats, as well as with the involvement of international organizations, in order to restore and build peace,\u201d the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine underlines.\n\nThe diplomats note that they are creating a belt of security and prosperity by implementing the strategy of small alliances as an element of Ukraine's proactive foreign policy. That is how the Lublin Triangle with Poland and Lithuania, the Quadriga with Turkey, the Associated Trio with Georgia and Moldova, and the Ukraine-Poland-UK alliance emerged.\n\n\u201cTogether with 46 of our foreign partners and international organizations, we have established the International Crimean Platform, a new format for the peaceful de-occupation of Crimea. We do develop the Platform to contain Russia's geopolitical and military ambitions, and maintain stability in the wider Black Sea region,\u201d the Ministry says.\n\nThe MFA expresses its gratitude to the states that provide Ukraine with political and practical support in order to strengthen its defence resilience and calls for further intensification of bilateral military-technical cooperation to this end.\n\n\u201cRussia must de-escalate, withdraw its military forces from Ukraine's sovereign territory and stop destabilizing the international security situation,\u201d the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine underscores.\n\nThe Law of Ukraine \"On introduction of amendments into some Laws of Ukraine\" (as to the date the temporarily occupation started)\" of September 15, 2015, No. 685-VIII defines February 20 as the official date of the beginning of the temporary occupation of Crimea.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, Russia committed an international crime, violated the basic principles of international law and the European system, destroyed the existing balance of power in the region, caused the largest security crisis in Europe since World War II. Grossly violating Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, Russian troops began occupying Crimea. Trucks without number plates, the so-called \"green men\" \u2013 armed soldiers wearing unmarked green army uniforms \u2013 appeared on the peninsula. At the same time, irregular formations of mercenaries from among local residents were created and provided with weapons, led by officers of the special services and the armed forces of the Russian Federation.\n\nOn the night of February 27, the buildings of the Parliament and the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea were seized by Russian special forces and Russian flags were set on them. A so-called \"referendum\" was held on March 16, and two days later, on March 18, Crimea's \"accession\" to Russia was announced.\n\nol",

        "content": "MINSK, 26 February (BelTA) \u2013 Belarus is ready to provide a venue for peaceful negotiations on settling the conflict in Ukraine, BelTA learned from Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko on 26 February.\n\nAleksandr Lukashenko said: \u201cWe are open. They can come today. We will provide everything and will help in this regard in order to prevent a war and slaughter. It is still a conflict for now. A conflict in the inflammation stage. It has to be stopped. You know our stance. I spoke about it on the first day.\u201d\n\nHe went on saying: \u201cI suggested [a negotiation venue] on the first day. They were supposed to come the next day. Vladimir Putin called me and said\u2026 Well, various games are being played over there. Some want Warsaw and some America. Listen, Kiev is virtually surrounded while they keep prating. People are dying while they keep prating! But you heard the view of the president of Russia yesterday, it was expressed. He talked to me about it. I told him: the door is open, they are welcome to come to any location, even to the Palace of Independence. We will provide everything: we will welcome them, talk to them, show them, and tell them. And full security. Feel free to come.\u201d\n\nThe president stressed that it is necessary to stop this conflict while it is still possible. \u201cTomorrow it will be a war and the day after tomorrow it will be slaughter. This is why if they are smart, all kinds of crazy, they should make the decision and start negotiations. Since Russia encourages them for the third time in the last few days and gives consent and they already accept the conditions Russia has suggested today, why do they have to take things slowly? People are dying after all! It is the first consideration. And then nobody may want negotiations tomorrow. The winning country (you probably don't doubt what may happen) may simply be unwilling to talk to anyone,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko noted. \u201cThis is why madmen! And it seems to me there are still forces, which encourage this regime [in Ukraine] and push them to keep fighting, promising that bandits from Afghanistan and from the Middle East will come to help soon. And there are plenty of private military companies of their own. Those are professional soldiers, professional murderers. If they become involved, you can imagine what will happen in Ukraine. This is why neither Russia nor Belarus wants that. It is even more dangerous for us.\u201d\n\nAleksandr Lukashenko also pointed out that attempts are being made to portray Belarus as a warring party. \u201cEveryone from Japan to America is trying to attach us to this war. Sanctions against us are being announced already. If I am not mistaken, this gang (as Putin put it) from the International Olympic Committee has made some statement and went nearly as far as saying we fight in this war. Well, they'd been looking for a reason. It is clear they got an overseas phone call, which told them what to do. So they start acting. But we will endure. Preventing people from getting killed is what matters. Those are close and dear people to us, a close and dear country,\u201d the president concluded.",

        "content": "The United Nations Security Council has convened almost a dozen meetings on Ukraine since late January, six of those coming since the brutal Russian invasion began last month. The resulting meetings seeking to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion, calling for a cease-fire and humanitarian corridors, have achieved almost nothing \u2013 because Russia, as one of five permanent members of the 15-member body, has veto power and so far has used that veto to halt any action against it.\n\nThe United Nations was formed after World War II with the aim of halting future wars, but as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns the world about a new world war, the Security Council is being used by Russia to deflect any meaningful action against it. And it seems that even the United Nations secretary-general is frustrated by the inaction.\n\nWHO CHIEF: ACCESS TO MARIUPOL, OTHER BESIEGED AREAS OF UKRAINE NOW 'CRITICAL'\n\nStephane Dujarric, the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, acknowledged those frustrations. \"The complicating factor to put an end to this crisis is the division within the Security Council. As we have seen before, whenever the Security Council is divided, whenever especially the five permanent members of the Security Council are divided, it just makes achieving peace that much more complicated.\"\n\nKelly Craft, who was the United States ambassador to the world body from 2019-2021, told Fox News Digital that the council has failed when it comes to Ukraine. \"While the U.N. Security Council can reach majority opinion and sometimes consensus on pressing international issues, there are glaring times when it is a complete failure. This is one such case,\" said Craft. \"With Russia, a veto-wielding permanent member of the council, there is no way to avoid Moscow blocking a resolution that would condemn Russian aggression and support a ceasefire that would end to this horrific war.\"\n\nCraft said that while the nonbinding U.N. General Assembly vote to condemn Russia earlier this month was helpful in isolating President Vladimir Putin in the international community and noted the U.N.\u2019s essential humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and neighboring countries, she said the Russian invasion has shown the U.N.\u2019s weakness. \"The basic truth is that meaningful UN action on a geopolitical front is woefully inadequate in putting an end to this conflict. This underscores the limitations of the United Nations as an international body to address the perils of our times and makes it abundantly clear that other ways to resolve the conflict need to be pursued in tandem.\"\n\nRichard Gowan, the U.N. director of the International Crisis Group (ICG), recently wrote in Foreign Affairs that the war in Ukraine threatened to do long-term damage to the U.N. and said that while observers of the Security Council were not surprised at its inability to come together over Ukraine, noting past council failures over Syria and Burma, he told Fox News Digital the council still had a useful role to play. \"We have to be realistic about what the Security Council can and cannot do. It is quite useful when it comes to managing peacekeeping Africa or humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. One small bright spot in the recent mess over Ukraine is that Russia decided not to block an important UN resolution on keeping a UN mission in Afghanistan, which will help get aid to suffering Afghans.\"\n\nU.S., ALLIES ACCUSE RUSSIA OF USING UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO 'LAUNDER' DISINFORMATION ON UKRAINE\n\nOne of the critics taking issue with the performance of the United Nations Security Council and the organization\u2019s handling of the Ukraine crisis is Clifford May, the president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD). May said the world body has become an increasingly dysfunctional organization, noting, \"This has been apparent for years to anyone paying close attention. Sadly, very few people in Congress or the State Department have been paying close attention.\"\n\nAddressing the inability of the U.N. Security Council to get anything done over Ukraine, May said he could see the potential for a different approach: \"One can imagine an alternative to the U.N. Security Council and, indeed, to the increasingly dysfunctional U.N. system\u2026 but that would require a long-term project, one that the current administration is unlikely even to begin.\"\n\nMay also took aim at the performance of Guterres during the present crisis, \"The U.N. secretary-general is hardly a profile in courage. But he almost certainly sees his job as performing functions \"entrusted\" to him by the United Nations Security Council on which Russia and China sit as permanent, veto-wielding members. And neither Russia nor China are entrusting him to help save Ukrainian lives or preserve the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine, a UN member-state.\"\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE WAR: KREMLIN MISSILE ATTACKS STRIKE LVIV, SEEN AS AID DESTINATION AND CROSSROADS FOR REFUGEES\n\nDujarric took issue with criticism aimed at his boss and told Fox News Digital that Guterres remained actively focused on the humanitarian and diplomatic aspects of the Russian invasion. \"The secretary-general has been in constant contact with numerous leaders and parties. Among them are heads of the governments and senior leaders of Ukraine, Poland, Moldova, Turkey, Israel. Finland, France, Russia, and many others.\"\n\nHe said the secretary-general had been outspoken and made clear from day one of the conflict that the war needed to stop immediately and Russian troops needed to end hostilities and withdraw from Ukraine. \"From the very first day of the conflict, he made an appeal to the President of the Russian Federation to cease fighting. As he has been emphasizing, countless innocent people \u2013 including women and children \u2013 have been killed, and this escalating violence is totally unacceptable. The protection of civilians must be priority number one.\"\n\nThe ICG\u2019s Gowan said there could still be a bigger role for Guterres and the U.N. in helping to end the invasion. He said Guterres \"had no choice but to condemn Russia's war last month, and that was the right thing to do. But as soon as he spoke out against Moscow, Russia decided that they cannot trust him as a mediator. So he has little political traction with Moscow and cannot play a significant diplomatic role unless Putin decides it needs UN help to end the war.\"\n\nHe said there may even be a point when Russia will need the U.N.\u2019s help. \"I can just about imagine a scenario in which Moscow decides it needs to cut its losses and cease hostilities and turns to the UN to help it do so. That could mean asking for UN observers to patrol a ceasefire line for example. Russia could try to take credit for this diplomatic solution at the U.N. to offset its military problems, but this sort of idea remains quite hypothetical at the moment.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly is again expected to meet this week in an emergency special session on Ukraine. A draft resolution entitled \"Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine\" will be debated and come up for a vote.\n\nThe resolution is expected to be similar to the one sponsored by France and Mexico that failed to get even a hearing at the Security Council. If, as expected, it does get a majority of votes in the general assembly the resolution, unlike a Security Council one, is not legally binding and therefore a largely symbolic one.",

        "content": "The Ukrainian media community has urged foreign colleagues to avoid calling Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as \u2018Ukraine Crisis\u2019 or \u2018conflict\u2019.\n\nThe relevant statement was made by them in the Open Letter to media professionals who cover Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.\n\nIn this letter, Ukrainian media professionals are calling on foreign colleagues to not use misleading terms, which support Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign.\n\nIn particular, the Ukrainian media community is urging the foreign media to not call Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as \u2018crisis\u2019, \u2018conflict\u2019 or \u2018military operation\u2019 and avoid calling it \u2018Ukrainian\u2019 (\u2018Ukraine crisis\u2019 or \u2018Ukraine conflict\u2019). Russia\u2019s role in war must be indicated correctly with the wording \u2018Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019 or \u2018Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine\u2019.\n\nThe authors of the letter are also asking the foreign media to not overuse the phrase \u2018Putin\u2019s war\u2019. Even though there is a temptation to believe that this war started only because of the Russian president, several polls from diverse polling organizations (Savanta ComRes, VCIOM, the research project \u201cDo Russians Want War?\u201d) have reported that the silent majority of Russians \u2013 roughly 60 percent \u2013 support the war. During the first week of the war, public support for Putin in Russia grew from 60 to 71 percent. Russian soldiers on the ground are firing missiles and bombs, and deliberately killing civilians. Many of them do not have access to the facts and to independent media, but this does not take responsibility away from them.\n\nThe Ukrainian media community is calling on foreign journalists to clearly note that \u2018the territories of Crimea, and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, were annexed and occupied by Russian forces in 2014\u2019 and avoid reporting Ukrainian and Russian positions as \u201ctwo equal perspectives\u201d, since Russian positions are based on lies, propaganda and denial of the existence of Ukraine as a nation and state. Foreign media professionals are asked to include, engage and hear Ukrainian experts, or those who have lived and worked in Ukraine, in the journalism they publish about the war.\n\n\u201cThe narrative that characterizes the war as a proxy one between Russia and the West denies Ukrainian agency \u2013 something that the Ukrainian people\u2019s resistance to invasion clearly demonstrates. NATO is an alliance based on the right of sovereign nations to collective defense, enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. By focusing on \u2018expansion\u2019, the media are perpetuating the Kremlin\u2019s justification for war and ignoring the democratic voice of the Ukrainian people who wish to live in peace, free from Russian aggression,\u201d the Ukrainian media community noted.\n\nThe authors of the letter also mentioned that four media professionals had already been killed by the Russian military: Oleksandra Kuvshynova, Brent Renaud, Evgen Sakun and Pierre Zakrzewski. Russian forces kidnap Ukrainian journalists in order to silence them, thus a Ukrainian journalist Viktoriya Roschina and Oleh Baturin spent 6 and 8 days in captivity after disappearing. Ukrainian photojournalist Maks Levin disappeared on March 13, 2022, while reporting from the frontline near Kyiv. The publisher from Melitopol, Mikhail Kumok, and three journalists \u2013 Yevgeniya Boryan, Yuliya Olkhovska and Lyubov Chaika \u2013 had been detained for 1 day and pressured to collaborate with the Russian occupational regime in their city.\n\nThe Open Letter was signed by Internews Ukraine, Institute of Mass Information, Commission on Journalism Ethics, Ukrainian Association of Media Psychologists and Media Educators, National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, Souspilnist Foundation, Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, Suspilne, Ukrayinska Pravda, hromadske, LB.ua, Zaborona Media, Realnaya Gazeta, Glavcom, Center for Democracy and Rule of Law, Regional Press Development Institute, Detector media NGO.\n\nPhoto: Stringer, Anadolu Agency",

        "content": "The Netherlands should take a firmer and clearer stance in supporting Ukraine, including in its EU integration aspirations, the Ukrainian and Dutch honorary consuls wrote in an open appeal to the Dutch prime minister and parliament.\n\nIn 2014, Russia started a hybrid war in the Donbas and Crimea. Peace, freedom and security have been taken for granted for generations. The new Russian invasion in 2022 is a turning point in history. Good leaders speak up, have a vision. As honorary consuls of a country at war, we cannot remain silent now. We speak out. We are impressed by Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission who, on Day 3 of the war, spoke out in favor of Ukraine's accession to the European Union. \"In the long run, they do belong to us,\" said von der Leyen when asked about Ukraine's possible accession to the EU. \"They belong to us and we want them to be part of it.\" This is a vision of Europe and a heart among belt for all those Ukrainians who fight for the European values \u200b\u200bthat we consider normal: freedom, security and democracy.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Rutte can take an example from Von der Leyen and Zelensky by having a clear vision as a leader for the future of Europe, especially in times of need. Rutte was not clear with his statements: \u201cNot a good discussion to discuss this now. A very time consuming, complicated and complex process. That could take decades. A very long-term process.\u201d Nowhere did Rutte give the people of Ukraine the hope or perspective of his support for accession to the EU. A missed opportunity. Of course, Ukraine must meet strict accession conditions, for which it can use all the help. Stand on the right side of history and be clear that you support the ambition: a democratic and independent Ukraine as a member of the EU and the European family. And as von der Leyen said, \u201cover time\u201d. We call on Prime Minister Rutte to state clearly that he supports the ambition of 43 million Ukrainians to join the EU from his heart and that he will also make every effort to ensure that Ukraine receives EU candidate status. We call on parliament and all Dutch people to support this wholeheartedly.\n\nThe reconstruction of Ukraine will take place after the war. This war must be ended as soon as possible. Acting hard towards Russia is what helps. \u201cWe must put a stop to Russian aggression, Putin's aggression,\u201d Rutte said in parliament. President Zelensky says from Kyiv: \u201cIt is time to make a choice, it is time for black or white, the good and the bad.\u201d It's time to choose sanctions that really force Russia to end the war. The Netherlands can do much more. The Netherlands is the gateway to Europe, close all Dutch ports and waterways for ships under the Russian flag or with a Russian owner (UBO). With this we also deny Russian ships access to the German hinterland and the ports of Antwerp and Ghent. Do not dawdle, do not seek excuses, do not wait for Europe. As a guide country, the Netherlands can decide this independently. Don't wait a day longer. Close the ports now! In addition, it is important to disconnect additional Russian banks from SWIFT, such as Sberbank and Gazprombank. Russia should be forced much harder to end this war of annihilation. The freezing of 80 billion euros in tax evasion via all kinds of \u2018Amsterdam South Axis\u2019 constructions must also be tackled much more actively.\n\nThe Dutch honorary consul gave a speech on Dam Square Amsterdam, while his Ukrainian colleague was at the same time as his family 1500 km away in his air raid shelter. Both endorse what was said in that speech and you can see and listen to it via social media. Message: Appeasement doesn't work with a dictator and former KGB member. The Kremlin has no respect for that. Don't be afraid of Putin; \"Don't be a pussy!\"\n\nAndriy Hrynchuk, Honorary Consul of the Netherlands to Ukraine\n\nKarel Burger Dirven, 1st Honorary Consul of Ukraine to the Netherlands\n\nLviv (UA),\u2019s-Hertogenbosch (NL), March 24, 2022\n\nPhoto, from left to right: Honorary Consuls Karel Burger Dirven and Andriy Hrynchuk",

        "content": "Civil society, media organizations and human rights associations have called on the international community to hold Russia accountable for crimes committed in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Ukrinform, the civil society, media organisations and associations, and media outlets of Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia said this in an open statement on taking urgent and necessary measures to restore international law and order and overcome the consequences of the international security catastrophe caused by the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The open statement was published on the website of the Independent Media Council.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation launched a large-scale invasion into sovereign and independent Ukraine in violation of the imperative norms of international law. This invasion was a continuation of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine that started in March 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the subsequent occupation of part of the eastern territories of Ukraine. There is currently a large-scale international armed conflict in the heart of Europe, in which Russia is resorting to war crimes as a deliberately chosen strategy of terror against civilians, the document says.\n\nThe authors say that this this conflict has posed the greatest threat to world peace since World War II and could lead to the complete destruction of international law and order and the world\u2019s entry into an era of \u201cwar of all against all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis catastrophe became possible due to laziness, cowardice, and conformism of international institutions and organisations that have failed to effectively defend the principles of democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. It also became possible because by relying confidently on the international standards and norms developed after World War II, we did not pay attention to the fact that the all-encompassing technological \u201cdisruption\u201d of recent years could require a substantial revision and/or adaptation of at least some of these standards,\u201d the document says.\n\nThe authors of the statement call on the international community and competent international organisations to:\n\n\u0406. Demonstrate genuine commitment to the spirit of international law and the necessary political will to expel the Russian Federation from the UN Security Council. A country that has repeatedly violated the fundamental principles of the United Nations has no legal or moral right to be a permanent member of one of its key bodies.\n\n\u0406\u0406. Recognize that the UN\u2019s structure and certain operational procedures (above all, the rules of the work of the UN Security Council) were based on the political realities of the end of World War II and are neo-colonial and unjust by their nature. They have long been unable to uphold international law and order. For this reason, it is necessary to immediately begin the review process of the basic mechanisms of the UN with the aim of substantially reforming them to effectively ensure the preservation of peace.\n\n\u0406\u0406\u0406. Ensure that the Russian Federation is brought to justice for the international crimes committed against Ukraine, including the crime of aggression and war crimes. Should it be impossible to engage the International Criminal Court effectively, it is necessary to establish a special international tribunal to investigate and punish the crimes committed by Russian officials and military personnel against Ukraine.\n\nIV. Given that Russia\u2019s armed aggression against Ukraine incorporates a significant information component, the aforementioned international tribunal must consider holding liable a number of Russian media figures who deliberately, systematically, and massively developed and implemented aggressive information operations to spread disinformation, incitement to hatred, propaganda for and justification of Russian aggression against Ukraine. A provisional list of persons to be brought to justice is proposed in Annex 1 to this Statement. A non-exhaustive list of verified sources and reports with examples and evidence of such aggressive information operations is provided in Annex 2 to this Statement.\n\nV. Recognize that freedom of expression and freedom of the media should in no way extend to aggressive information operations that are funded, controlled, and/or otherwise supported by countries with unlawful intent. Immediately begin the process of international consultations involving representatives of civil society, academia, and the media to develop a legal framework to limit and counter aggressive information operations at the global and regional levels. Numerous testimonies from Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine clearly demonstrate how aggressive information operations lead to actual armed conflicts. For the sake of protection of peace, this practice must be eradicated.\n\nVI. Recognize that information aggression is not merely a supporting factor in modern conflicts but rather a powerful main component of them. Immediately begin the process of international consultations to develop an updated definition of aggression for the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to include aggressive information operations.\n\nThe authors of the document stress that the successful implementation is possible and necessary to preserve the civilizational achievements of humanity and overcome the global security crisis.\n\nThe document was signed by about 80 organizations from Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus and Georgia.\n\nPhoto: AA",

        "content": "Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Australian parliament that his country is \u201cundefeatable\u201d against Russia as long as it can count on the support of the global community.\n\nIn a virtual speech to MPs and senators in Canberra, the Ukrainian president requested Australia send Bushmaster armoured vehicles to assist in the fight against Russia, saying they would \u201cdo much more for our common freedom and security than staying parked on your land\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou have very good armoured personal vehicles, Bushmasters, that could help Ukraine substantially, and other pieces of equipment that could strengthen our position in terms of armaments,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\nZelenskiy accused Vladimir Putin of \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d and said that an unchecked Russia was a \u201cthreat\u201d to the world, suggesting its actions may inspire other nations to follow suit, in a thinly veiled warning to the parliament he was addressing.\n\n\u201cThe distance between our countries is big, it\u2019s thousands of kilometres \u2026 but there\u2019s no such thing as distance for the brutality and chaos that Russia brought to the east of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\n\u201cWhatever is happening in our region because of the Russian aggression \u2026 has become a real threat to your country and your people as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the nature of the evil. It can instantly cross any distance, any barriers, destroy lives.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy, clad in his now-signature black T-shirt, spoke via an interpreter on video link to a packed House of Representatives on Thursday night. He called for Russia to pay \u201cthe highest price\u201d and for allies to impose even tougher sanctions, such as blocking Russian vessels from foreign ports and boycotting the country\u2019s oil.\n\nBefore Zelenskiy\u2019s address, Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, called Putin \u201cthe war criminal of Moscow\u201d in his strongest condemnation of the Russian president yet.\n\nMorrison also announced an extra $25m in military assistance for Ukraine, including unmanned aerial and ground systems, rations and medical supplies. The commitment takes Australia\u2019s military contributions to Ukraine to $116m.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Australian government vowed to slug all imports from Russia and Belarus with an extra 35% tariff.\n\nIn a statement, Morrison called out \u201cRussia\u2019s brutal, unrelenting and illegal invasion\u201d of Ukraine, and said the government \u201cwill continue to identify opportunities for further military assistance\u201d.\n\nMorrison praised Zelenskiy as a \u201clion of democracy\u201d.\n\nThe Australian Labor opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, slammed Putin for \u201caggression in the name of a poisonous, nationalistic lie\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou are showing us what true courage is,\u201d Albanese said, speaking directly to Zelenskiy.\n\nThe Ukrainian president warned that other nations may follow Russia\u2019s lead in attacking their \u201cneighbours\u201d unless the world stood up now \u2013 in a clear reference to China, which has so far resisted taking a stronger line in discouraging Putin\u2019s aggression.\n\n\u201cThe worst pages of the 20th century have been brought back by Russia already,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cThe biggest threats of that century came back, the evil that humanity thought they had forgotten about a long time ago.\n\n\u201cBut the most terrible thing, if we don\u2019t stop Russia now, if we don\u2019t hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world who are looking forward to a similar war against their neighbours will decide that such things are possible for them.\u201d\n\nThe president also spoke confidently and optimistically about the future of his country.\n\n\u201cWe know that our dream is undefeatable and indestructable, especially if we can count on the support of the free world, on your support, on your assistance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need it not just in a couple of months, we need it urgently, now.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy said Ukraine\u2019s citizens were \u201calready thinking about the future, about how we\u2019re going to live after the war, and of restoring our country\u201d.\n\nAustralia has provided $156m in support to Ukraine since Russia began its invasion in February, including $91m in \u201clethal and non-lethal military assistance\u201d, which was confirmed in Tuesday evening\u2019s budget papers.\n\nAustralia also plans to offer Ukrainians fleeing the conflict a three-year temporary humanitarian visa. It has also joined a range of countries imposing sanctions on Russia.\n\nOn Thursday, Morrison said the Australian government was \u201ctaking further action to increase the economic costs to Russia after its illegal invasion of Ukraine, supported by Belarus, by applying an additional tariff of 35% for all imports from Russia and Belarus\u201d.\n\nAustralia does not have a big trading relationship with Russia. In 2019-20, Australia imported $250m in goods from Russia, such as fertilisers ($71m) and crude petroleum ($59m).\n\nBy contrast, Australia exported $723m in goods to Russia in 2019-20, including live animals, specialised machinery and meat, according to data compiled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat).\n\nDfat listed Australia as a lowly 94th on the list of Russia\u2019s main export destinations before the pandemic.\n\nThe Australian government has been particularly critical of the growing alignment between Russia and China \u2013 concerns shared by a top UK intelligence chief.\n\nThe director of GCHQ, Sir Jeremy Fleming, told an audience in Canberra that there were risks to both Russia and China from being \u201ctoo closely aligned\u201d.\n\n\u201cRussia understands that long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically,\u201d Fleming said in a speech to the Australian National University. \u201cSome of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation.\n\n\u201cAnd it is equally clear that a China that wants to set the rules of the road \u2013 the norms for a new global governance \u2013 is not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores them all.\u201d",

        "content": "Several actions by Russia in recent days, along with a looming holiday that is culturally significant within the country, point to Russia escalating its invasion of Ukraine in the near future, an expert tells Fox News Digital.\n\nRebekah Koffler, a former U.S. DIA intelligence officer focused on Russia and the author of \"Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America,\" told Fox News Digital Friday that May 9, the day Russia celebrates victory over Germany in World War II, is a date by which Putin feels pressure to achieve some sort of victory in Ukraine.\n\nRUSSIA TO MOBILIZE 60,000 RESERVISTS AS IT SETS ITS SIGHTS ON EASTERN UKRAINE: SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL\n\n\"It\u2019s the 77th anniversary of what the Russians call the Great Patriotic War, which is what the West calls World War II,\" Koffler explained. \"It's a massive holiday, and they typically have got a huge military parade where they display all their latest weapons technology. I just anticipate that [Putin] is going to do everything possible to claim a victory, whether he in fact can achieve that or not. There\u2019s a tremendous pressure to continue this tradition.\"\n\nKoffler added that the Russian government uses the holiday as a time to strategically promote its military power, and the show of force is important to Putin in terms of his legacy.\n\nHOW BAD IS THE CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT IN RUSSIA?\n\nDefense analyst professor Michael Clarke agreed with that assessment in a recent interview, saying that \"all intelligence indicates that Putin is desperate to get something out of this war in time for the ninth of May.\"\n\nKoffler also explained that a recent quote from Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov shows Russia has an idea of when and how to bring the conflict to an end.\n\nPeskov said in an interview with Sky News that the Russian Federation\u2019s \"operation will reach its goals or end in talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegation in the next few days, in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nPeskov added that, as of now, the \"operation continues and the goals are being achieved.\"\n\nKoffler says that comment suggests that Russia has a plan on when to force an end to the conflict and sends a signal that the Kremlin is counting on the military strategy and negotiation strategy \"intersecting\" sometime soon.\n\nAdditionally, Koffler pointed to a recent comment from Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, who suggested that sanctions levied against Russia by the West could be interpreted as \"international aggression.\" Medvedev suggested that, as a result, Russia has the right to individual and collective defense from that aggression under international law.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKoffler told Fox News Digital that comment could indicate that Russia is getting ready for a \"massive\" escalation in the war that could be \"catastrophic.\"\n\nKoffler\u2019s assessment is that the escalation could come in the form of a devastating airstrike or a full-on assault of Odesa, which is an area Putin has long coveted and that could cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea.\n\nThe Odesa region, which is sometimes referred to as New Russia, harking back to the time of Catherine the Great, would be a \"huge\" acquisition for Putin\u2019s legacy, Koffler explained, adding that controlling that area would allow Putin to claim a significant victory even though his primary goal of toppling Kyiv was not achieved.\n\n\"This timeline to them is significant,\" Koffler said. \"We are about to experience an escalation, a last-ditch push.\"",

        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine began, Vladimir Putin and his commanders have failed in their campaign to rapidly destroy a democratic nation.\n\nDue to the effectiveness of the Ukrainian military, the bravery of the Ukrainian people, and the strong leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his team, we enter a sixth week of war even though many predicted the fight would be over in days.\n\nTherefore, it is time for the world to assess the outcome we would like to achieve regarding the current conflict.\n\nUS SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE GOAL VIS-A-VIS UKRAINE \u2013 TO HELP IT ACHIEVE VICTORY AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE\n\nWith the right support from democracies around the globe, Putin could suffer an embarrassing and stunning loss.\n\nAfter the butchery in Bucha, the answer could not be clearer \u2013 I want to see victory for Ukraine and defeat for Putin.\n\nThe only question in people\u2019s minds is what such a loss should entail. A clear and concise strategy on how the world can ensure the sovereignty of Ukraine and hold Putin accountable includes:\n\nExpanded NATO membership\n\nIf Finland and Sweden join NATO, they will make the alliance even stronger. Additional members of the alliance would further expand the military capabilities of NATO, creating a stronger, more well-rounded force.\n\nPutin\u2019s invasion has crystallized the need for NATO members to meet the 2% GDP spending obligation for defense. Increasing NATO\u2019s presence on Putin\u2019s doorstep would send a strong and clear message that the world will not tolerate his unprovoked invasion, and the freedom-loving world is prepared to curtail any further aggression.\n\nEuropean oil and gas customers abandoning Putin\n\nThe effort by European countries to shed themselves of Russian oil and gas should accelerate and include a no-turning-back commitment to that goal.\n\nPutin should be viewed as an outlaw and war criminal on the world stage.\n\nWhen this conflict ends and Putin has fewer European customers for his oil and gas, it will be a devastating blow to his ability to wage war. Other countries outside of Europe must also know that there will be consequences should they decide to replace his lost European customers.\n\nAccountability for Putin and his generals' war crimes\n\nThere must be an ongoing effort to hold Putin and the generals who carried out the attacks on innocent Ukrainian civilians accountable as the war criminals they are.\n\nThe international community should support the International Criminal Court\u2019s investigation and other investigations that arise into his barbarity.\n\nPutin should be viewed as an outlaw and war criminal on the world stage.\n\nA \"forgive and forget\" approach to Putin and his war crimes will only set the stage for further aggression. If Putin winds up losing this conflict and is left isolated on the global stage, then the brave Ukrainians will not have died in vain.\n\nContinued sanctions punishing Putin\u2019s regime for the invasion of Ukraine\n\nEconomic sanctions should remain in full force as long as Putin and his cronies occupy one inch of Ukrainian territory. We must also maintain a firm and unequivocal commitment to keeping the crushing sanctions in place without any loopholes.\n\nAdditional weapons support for Ukraine\n\nA loss for Putin is possible if the freedom-loving world goes all-in for victory. All-in means providing the Ukrainian Armed Forces with additional lethal aid and capabilities such as larger Switchblade drones, fighter aircraft, more sophisticated missile defense systems, and tanks to take the fight to Putin.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has proven to be a formidable foe and must have the continued ability to defend themselves far in the future. The more damage the Ukrainian military can do the sooner this conflict will end on favorable terms. Lethal assistance is critical to the ongoing fight.\n\nThe Ukrainians are committed to victory on the battlefield. The United States and our allies must be as well.\n\nThe Biden administration and the western world must not let Putin determine how we assist Ukraine in their fight for freedom.\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s continued leadership of Ukraine.\n\nLast but not least, a devastating loss for Putin would preserve the administration of President Zelenskyy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn order to ensure a sovereign Ukraine, security guarantees from Western nations like the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany and other nations will be needed. These guarantees must ensure the United States, and others, would come to Ukraine\u2019s aid if there were a future invasion.\n\nIt is critical that these new security guarantees be stronger than the Budapest Memorandum and reflect mutual defense agreements that the United States has with other nations outside of NATO like South Korea, Australia and Japan.\n\nFor this war to end in a way that would deter future wars, Putin must be stopped and a democratic Ukraine must still remain standing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe world is watching. The strong actions we take today will impact bad actors in the future who may think twice before engaging in conflict. China is less likely to invade Taiwan, and Iran may have a different view of the Western world if we are successful in Ukraine.\n\nThis is a historic moment in which we can reinforce all the values freedom-loving people hold near and dear. The best way to honor those killed in Ukraine who have fought valiantly for their freedom, who died at the hands of war criminals, is for Ukraine to be successful.",

This is a serious challenge for all of us.\"In an interview with Xinhua News, this was commented by a spokesman for the Chinese ministry of diplomacy Zhao Lijian.\n\nChina: NATO disregards the facts and confuses black with white\n\n- For some time, the head of NATO disregarded the facts and confuses black with white, casting unfounded accusations, slandering and attacking China.He gave irresponsible comments on China's foreign policy, emphasized \"threat from China\", and recently even used compulsion to them.China condemns and reject such behavior, and also made solemn statements in NATO many times - said Lijian.\n\nAt the same time, he accused NATO that \"for a long time he was sticking to the outdated security concept, he was involved in block confrontations in accordance with the textbook of the Old Cold War and reduced to the hegemony tool of a country.\"- By claiming that NATO is a defensive organization, in fact it constantly causes trouble and causes confrontations.Asking other countries about compliance with basic standards regulating international relations, NATO waged war against sovereign countries and fired bullets massively, which led to the death and displacement of civilians - he said in an interview.\n\nIn the rest of the conversation Lijian went to an even more surprising opinion.\n\n- China's development means opportunities for the world, not a threat to anyone.NATO should immediately stop distributing disinformation and provocative comments on China and abandon the confrontational approach consisting in setting ideological lines.NATO has disturbed order in Europe.He should stop trying to destabilize Asia and the whole world - said the Chinese official.\n\nThe rest of the article under video material:\n\nContinuation of the material under the video\n\nChina blames NATO for the war in Ukraine\n\nZhao Lijian's statements are the next installment of the conflict on the NATO-China line.Last month, the deputy head of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng blamed NATO for the war in Ukraine and criticized the West for sanctions introduced against Russia - the Associated Press agency reported in mid -March.\n\nDuring the conference in Beijing under the name \"Red War\", the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China warned that the further development of the war could cause \"repercussions too terrifying to even think about them\".\n\n- Sanctions against Russia have expanded to such an extent that now globalization is served as weapons.Even athletes, culture, art or entertainment were not spared - said Yucheng.\n\nSo far, China has still not officially condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Chinese representatives and local public media, to a large extent, blame the war to the United States and the West - notes the Axios information portal.\n\nSource: Xinhua News Agency, PAP\n\n(SP)",

Are considered the main architects of the Minsk Agreement, which was to lead peace in eastern Ukraine.As a result of the negotiations, however, the status quo was established, which was unacceptable to both sides of the conflict - and which Russia has acted with its invasion.\n\nPutin's man detained.What will be the fate of Medwedczuk?\n\nMedwedczuk is a part of his family for Putin - he is the godfather of his daughter.At the same time, the Kremlin leader is the godfather of the youngest daughter of Medwedczuk.It was these close ties that made Medwedczuk a mediator between Kiev and Moscow in 2014, when the oligarch was on the US sanction list for months.He also participated in several exchanges of prisoners between Ukraine and separatists in Donbas, occupied by Russia.\n\nHowever, his career as a mediator ended in 2019, when Wo\u0142odymyr Zelnski was elected president.He gave up his position because of misunderstandings with the new head of state.He was in opposition to Zelanski and \"saw no sense in his mediation work.\"Since then, the situation in Ukraine has become uncomfortable for Medwedczuk.\n\nIn February 2021, Zelanski ordered the first time to close pro -Russian television stations controlled by Medwedczuk.Then the oligarch was covered by sanctions for financing terrorism in Ukraine, and finally in May 2021 he was arrested at home on the charge of betrayal of state - includingHe was to provide Russia with secret information about the distribution of Ukrainian troops.\n\nAt the latest on February 26, two days after the start of the Russian invasion, Medwedczuk escaped from home custody, but not to Russia.Then, three weeks ago, Zelanski banned the activities of the Medwedczuk opposition Platform - for life for the duration of martial law.\n\nNow Wiktor Medwedczuk is to be replaced for captured Ukrainians.In Russia, he would not meet with joyful reception, because from the point of view of Putin Medwedczuk he failed.He was to secure the influence of the Kremlin in Ukraine, make Russia be able to count on politicians friendly to the Kremlin and voters loyal to Russia.The invasion of Russia and the definite resistance of Ukraine showed, however, that nothing was left of the promised pro -Russian society.\n\nThank you for being with us.Sign up for Onet's newsletter to receive the most valuable content from us.",

Also involving Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the visit marked the highest-level trip to Ukraine by US officials since the invasion began over two months ago.\n\nThe meeting between the US and Ukrainian parties, which ran for over three hours, comes as Russia escalates its military campaign in the south and east of the country.\n\nAt a news conference in Poland after the visit, Mr Austin told reporters the US wants to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\".\n\nThe Pentagon chief added that US officials still believed Ukraine could win the conflict with \"the right equipment\" and the \"right support\".\n\nBBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale observed that Mr Austin's comments calling for a weakened Russia were unusually strong for a US defence secretary. It is one thing to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it is quite another to speak of weakening Russia's capabilities, he said.\n\nMr Putin's accusations of the West attempting to \"destroy Russia\", made during a speech on Monday, appeared to be in response to Mr Austin's comments.",

One country has invaded another one. Putting them on the same footing fails to differentiate between the attacker and the attacked.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a blog by EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell.\n\n\u201cDefending Ukraine from Russia\u2019s invasion is rejecting the law of the jungle, the notion that \u201cmight makes right\u201d. Being \u201cneutral\u201d is a false concept here. One country has invaded another one. Putting them on the same footing fails to differentiate between the attacker and the attacked. Such \u201cneutrality\u201d may respond, of course, to a variety of reasons, from hidden alignment to fear of reprisals, but it becomes in practice support to Russia and its war of aggression,\u201d Borrell wrote.\n\nHe noted that the present conflict is not the outcome of centuries old hatreds: it is a war of choice, which is based on Vladimir Putin\u2019s own interpretation of history and is not adapted to realities of the 21st century.\n\nAt the same time, Putin\u2019s assumptions have proven clearly wrong: that the Ukrainian government would crumble and Russian forces would take Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities swiftly; that the European Union would be at pains to show resolve and respond to this aggression; that the \u201cWestern world\u201d would be divided and uncertain in its reaction; and that the broader international community would not condemn Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nInstead, Putin saw a consolidated and swift response on the part of the EU and its key international partners, as well as a powerful manifestation of Euro-Atlantic solidarity.\n\n\u201cUp to now, polls coming from Russia show significant support to the war, or rather the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d as baptised by the Russian leadership. However, this support rests on false information. If the Russian population knew what is happening, they would not be backing this awful conflict,\u201d The EU High Representative said.\n\nHe recalled that the Russian Duma had passed an impressive number of laws in the last weeks curtailing all possible freedom of reporting or expressing views on the war and imposing heavy penalties on anyone who does not accept the official version of events. Rallies against the war in multiple Russian cities have been repressed and the remaining free media have been fully silenced..\n\nThe authorities continue to peddle a false narrative of de-Nazification, coupled with allusions to undetermined threats against Russian security. Atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine are shamelessly re-attributed to the Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cSuch an accumulation of lies and falsehoods will backfire at some point. The Russian society is paying a high price for this war in many ways, and although the sanctions imposed by the EU and others in trying to end the conflict may initially help build a bunker mentality, the reality of events will one day be clear to Russian citizens. Tens of thousands have already left the country due to the war, the stifling censorship and the repression,\u201d Borrell said.\n\nIn addition, this is even truer because so far military activities have not favored Russia, despite its overwhelming military capacity when compared to Ukraine. Its Northern operation has been a failure and it has had to adjust its plans to concentrate its attacks on the Donbas and the South.\n\n\u201cHistory has repeatedly shown that wars of invasion are rarely successful. Even when weaker or less organised, the entire population of the invaded country often ends up rising against the invader or supporting those that fight against him,\u201d Borrell recalled.",

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said three people were in hospital.\n\n\u201cWe are still in shock. We were in the house when they bombed the building,\u201d Maksym Maksymov, 29, a sales manager, told the Guardian. \u201cWe heard the first strike. And the then a second missile hit the building.\u201d\n\nGuterres said he was shocked by the missile strikes, \u201cnot because I\u2019m here but because Kyiv is a sacred city for Ukrainians and Russians alike\u201d.\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskiy said the missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities \u201cprove that we cannot let our guard down\u201d.\n\nHe thanked the US for the proposed new funding saying that prompt weapons supplies were \u201csalvation not only for our people \u2013 this is salvation for all of you - for all of Europe\u201d.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nRussia\u2019s focus remains the Battle for Donbas but gains there are limited and have come at a \u201csignificant cost\u201d to Moscow\u2019s forces, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Friday. Fighting has been particularly heavy around Lysychansk and Severodonetsk.\n\nAbout 8,000 British army troops will take part in exercises across eastern Europe in one of the largest deployments since the cold war. The long-planned exercises had been enhanced in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion, the UK said.\n\nGuterres criticised his own organisation\u2019s security council while on visit to Kyiv, saying: \u201cLet me be very clear. The security council failed to do everything in its power to prevent and end this war. This is a source of great disappointment, frustration and anger.\u201d\n\nA British citizen has been killed and a second is missing, the Foreign Office has confirmed, amid reports that both were volunteers who had gone to fight in Ukraine. Scott Sibley is believed to be the first British fighter known to have been killed in combat there.\n\nThursday\u2019s missile strikes came hours after Biden asked Congress to give immediate approval for spending that would include over $33bn in military aid, involving everything from heavy artillery and armoured vehicles to greater intelligence sharing, cyberwarfare tools and many more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nBiden also requested $8.5bn in economic aid to Kyiv and $3bn in humanitarian relief, as well as funds to help increase US production of food crops and strategic minerals to offset the impact of the war in Ukraine on global supplies.\n\nThe total of $33bn is more than twice the last supplemental request approved by Congress in March and dwarfs the entire defense budget of Ukraine and of many other countries. The US president said it was aimed at helping Ukraine repel the renewed Russian offensives in the east and south of the country, but also to transition to assuring the nation\u2019s longer-term security needs.\n\nOn the same day, Congress agreed to update the 1941 lend-lease legislation with which Franklin D Roosevelt sought to help Britain and other allies fight Nazi Germany. The updated law is intended to make it easier for the US to provide military equipment to Ukraine.\n\nIt comes in the face of Russian warnings that increased western weapons supplies to Ukraine would endanger European security, that western intervention could bring instant Russian reprisals and raise the risk of nuclear conflict.\n\nMaking the case for western aid, Biden argued that on the contrary, if Putin was not stopped in Ukraine he would continue to threaten global peace and stability.\n\nThe president framed the request principally in terms of defending Ukraine, and did not explicitly repeat the declaration earlier this week by his defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, that one of US aims in Ukraine was to weaken Russia to stop it attacking other countries.\n\n\u201cDespite the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see. We\u2019re not attacking Russia. We\u2019re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said.

We can\u2019t let this happen.\u201d\n\nThe new military assistance the congressional funding will finance will include:\n\nMore artillery and armored vehicles, as well as anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft systems.\n\nHelp to build up Ukraine\u2019s cyberwarfare capabilities.\n\nMore intelligence sharing.\n\nSupport to increase Ukraine\u2019s ability to produce munitions and strategic minerals.\n\nAssistance in clearing landmines and other explosives and in Ukraine\u2019s defence against chemical, biological and dirty bomb attacks.\n\nA further buildup in the US military presence on Nato\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, warned on Thursday that an increased western supply of heavy weapons to Kyiv would endanger European security.\n\n\u201cThe tendency to pump weapons, including heavy weapons, into Ukraine, these are the actions that threaten the security of the continent, provoke instability,\u201d Peskov said.\n\nThe day before, Vladimir Putin had threatened a \u201clightning fast\u201d response to western intervention in Ukraine, adding: \u201cWe have all the weapons we need for this.\u201d\n\nHis foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has accused the US and its allies of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine and warned of the rising danger of a nuclear conflict.\n\nBiden rejected the accusation he was fighting a proxy war, describing the claim as part of the Kremlin\u2019s domestic propaganda to explain the inability of Russian forces to achieve their goals.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more of a reflection, not of the truth, but of their failure,\u201d the president said. He added: \u201cNo one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe package of proposals the administration is sending to Congress also includes measures to strengthen the hand of the justice department in pursuing Kremlin-aligned oligarchs seizing their assets and using the proceeds to support the war effort in Ukraine.\n\n1:23 War in Ukraine 'an absurdity in the 21st century', says UN chief \u2013 video\n\nBiden made his announcement as the UN secretary general was visiting Ukraine, where he described the war as \u201can absurdity\u201d in the 21st century.\n\nGuterres was touring Borodianka on Thursday, where Russian forces are accused of massacring civilians before their withdrawal, on his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the invasion on 24 February, before talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nIn nearby Bucha, where dozens of civilian bodies, some with their hands tied, were discovered this month, Guterres backed an investigation by the international criminal court into possible war crimes in Ukraine. \u201cI appeal to the Russian Federation to accept, to cooperate with the ICC,\u201d he said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova named 10 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in human rights abuses during the month-long occupation of Bucha.\n\nVenediktova also told German TV that that Ukrainian investigators had identified \u201cmore than 8,000 cases\u201d of suspected war crimes since Russia\u2019s invasion.",

Truss also delivered a direct warning to China.\n\n\u201cCountries must play by the rules. And that includes China,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Thursday Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, dismissed Truss\u2019s comments and accused Nato of demanding other countries abide by basic norms while it has \u201cwantonly waged wars and dropped bombs in sovereign states, killing and displacing innocent civilians\u201d.\n\n\u201cNato, a military organisation in the North Atlantic, has in recent years come to the Asia-Pacific region to throw its weight around and stir up conflicts,\u201d Wang said.\n\n\u201cNato has messed up Europe. Is it now trying to mess up the Asia-Pacific and even the world?\u201d\n\nIn her speech Truss said Nato had to pre-empt threats in the Indo-Pacific and extend its outlook to democracies outside its membership, like Taiwan, which Beijing claims is a breakaway Chinese province it must retake. She suggested China\u2019s economic rise \u2013 now the world\u2019s second largest economy to Britain\u2019s sixth \u2013 could be targeted.\n\n\u201c[China] will not continue to rise if they do not play by the rules. China needs trade with the G7. We [the Group of Seven] represent around half of the global economy. And we have choices,\u201d Truss said.\n\n\u201cWe have shown with Russia the kind of choices that we\u2019re prepared to make when international rules are violated.\u201d\n\nChina has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, one of its closest allies, drawing criticism and urgings from European and other governments to use its influence on Moscow. A recent China-EU summit was reportedly strained as Chinese representatives rebuffed pressure by European counterparts to help end the war. Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would pursue peace \u201cin its own way\u201d.\n\nBeijing firmly opposes linking the Ukraine war to its relations with Moscow and has said it will defend the rights of Chinese individuals and companies. On Thursday Wang said China\u2019s position on the conflict had been \u201cconsistent and clear\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have always made independent judgments based on the merits of the case,\u201d he said, adding no further detail.\n\nTruss has previously accused China and Russia being \u201caggressors working in concert\u201d, telling Australian media she couldn\u2019t rule out China using Russia\u2019s invasion as an opportunity to launch its own act of aggression.",

        "content": "They named themselves the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group and vowed to meet monthly until the war is won. A catchier, more accurate title would be the Stop Mad Vlad Coalition.\n\nThat\u2019s surely how Russia\u2019s friendless, paranoid president will view the US-led inaugural meeting of 40 Nato and non-Nato countries opposed to Russia\u2019s invasion. Even embarrassed China now steers clear of Moscow\u2019s Beria tribute act.\n\nThe group\u2019s launch was one of numerous political, rhetorical and military escalations last week \u2013 by both sides \u2013 that are rapidly transforming the Ukraine war into a fully fledged, open-ended international conflict. That in turn raises an alarming question: is all this fighting talk, all these threats and brinkmanship leading ineluctably towards nuclear confrontation?\n\nSergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, purposefully conjured that terrifying prospect when he claimed Nato\u2019s \u201cproxy war\u201d in Ukraine could trigger a third world war.\n\nLike a street corner spiv practising crude blackmail, Lavrov claimed there was a \u201cconsiderable risk\u201d such a war might go nuclear. Presumably he knows this because Putin is actually considering it.\n\nLiz Truss, Lavrov\u2019s British counterpart, dodged the nuclear question in her Mansion House speech \u2013 but went for the jugular. Her bold declaration that total victory, plus the liberation of all occupied Ukrainian territory including Crimea, was a \u201cstrategic imperative\u201d for the west may have surprised less gung-ho Nato allies who foolishly didn\u2019t realise she speaks for them.\n\nIf Putin won, \u201cwe would never feel safe again,\u201d Truss warned. By her reasoning, Putin has to go \u2013 preferably before the next Tory leadership contest.\n\nAmerica\u2019s tone has hardened significantly, too. US president Joe Biden says he stands by his vow in March that Putin \u201ccannot remain in power\u201d.\n\nLloyd Austin, his defence secretary, now says the US wants Russia permanently \u201cweakened\u201d. It should never again have the capability to threaten its neighbours, he said. Does Austin actually expect Putin to disarm? Despite denials, such loose statements sound like a push for regime change, even as Biden seeks a whopping $33bn in extra funding.\n\n\n\nPutin has also recklessly raised the stakes, threatening \u201cretaliatory strikes as quick as lightning\u201d against anyone meddling in Ukraine. To make his contemptuous point, he bombed Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN chief, who was visiting Kyiv.\n\nRussia says it may target Nato arms supply convoys. Explosions last week in a disputed region of Moldova are believed to be Russian false flag operations. This shows how easily the war could spread.\n\nIn many ways, it already has. Oil depots are ablaze in southern Russia. Poland protested it was under \u201cdirect attack\u201d after Moscow blocked gas supplies. The cut-off was denounced as a hostile act against Nato and the EU.\n\nGermany fears it may be next. But Berlin has nevertheless bowed to peer pressure to supply heavy weapons to Kyiv. Additional EU sanctions, including on oil, are imminent. All of this fuels an expanding fire.\n\nBiden has repeatedly insisted the conflict will be contained. \u201cDirect confrontation between Nato and Russia is world war three, something we must strive to prevent,\u201d he said after the invasion began.\n\nBut war has its own deathly momentum. Daily acts of escalation point in one direction. Nato is like a patient in denial. The reality, by many measures, is that it\u2019s already at war with Russia.\n\nFuture historians may map the path to wider conflagration in the same way the origins of the first world war were traced\n\nPerhaps future historians of the Ukraine conflict will map the path to wider conflagration in the same way academic predecessors traced the origins of the first world war.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to discern the developing pattern right now. Grievance, provocation, reaction, escalation, explosion. It\u2019s unravelling in plain sight. Yet unlike in 1914, or during the first cold war, there are no agreed limits or rules in this fight. Worldwide, from Iran to North Korea, counter-proliferation efforts fail. Nuclear arms control treaties lapse. A revived global nuclear arms race accelerates.\n\nMilitary planners have normalised the use of low-yield tactical (battlefield) nukes. Russian doctrine reserves the right to go nuclear in response to conventional threats, if the state (or leadership) is at risk. Russia\u2019s test last month of the nuclear-capable \u201cSatan II\u201d long-range missile carried a clear warning.\n\n\u201cGiven the setbacks they [Russia] have faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d CIA director William Burns warned.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the west cannot abandon Ukraine simply out of fear over how far manic Putin might go. Such a collapse would wreck the global order, the UN, and Europe\u2019s security. Yet the longer the war rages, the bigger the risk of a different kind of cataclysmic, world-changing event.\n\nSo here\u2019s the choice, as the northern English say: piss or get off the pot. Either the western allies act decisively, right now, to halt this war by demanding an immediate ceasefire and threatening and, if necessary, launching direct military intervention to secure it \u2013 as previously urged in this space.\n\nOr, alternatively, Truss, Austin and other hawks stop stoking the fire and setting unrealistic goals, and instead advise Kyiv to accept a negotiated settlement that, regrettably, will inevitably reward Putin\u2019s aggression.\n\nMany find both choices disturbing. At present, forceful Nato intervention to \u201cstop Mad Vlad\u201d remains unlikely because Biden, principally, believes it\u2019s too risky \u2013 even though he dearly wants shot of him.\n\nNo one in Kyiv favours a \u201cpeace\u201d deal at any price, as Guterres discovered. Nor will Putin give ground. On the contrary, he wants more.\n\nThus, in all probability, this war will grind on, murderously, chaotically, ruinously, amid the ever-present risk that uncontrolled escalation may produce a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nAs Lenin famously asked: what is to be done?",

        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nOn the sidewalk in Kyiv, in front of a key government office is a bronze statue of St. George spearing the dragon. The statue reflects the conviction of every Ukrainian I met. Ukraine is St. George, and Russia is the dragon.\n\nIn May 2021, I led a delegation from the American Foreign Policy Council to visit Ukraine. I visited over a dozen ministries in Kyiv, traveled to Mariupol, engaged with the Ukrainian Navy on the Sea of Azov, and went out onto the battlefield of Donbas.\n\nPUTIN VOWS THAT UKRAINE WAR GOALS WILL BE \u2018UNCONDITIONALLY FULFILLED\u2019\n\nDuring my visit, Kyiv was calm, but every Ukrainian I met was determined to remain out of the clutches of Russia. The consistent message of every person I met in Ukraine was that Ukrainians are not Russian and would never be made into Russians even if conquered. The Ukrainian officials made it clear that, as a people, they had decided that Ukraine\u2019s future was to be a democratic part of the West, within the European Union, and with membership in NATO.\n\nIn the face of this firm Ukrainian national identity, Russian President Vladimir Putin published a lengthy essay on his vision of Ukraine's future. In it, Putin stated that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\" and that Ukraine did not deserve to exist as an independent country. At the time of my visit, the Russian threat was building up. Now the Russian invasion is underway, using atrocities, rape, murder and deportation of civilians, mass destruction, and other war crimes, to crush the Ukrainian people. The port city of Mariupol has been bombed out of existence by Russia.\n\nFor more than 75 years, students of World War II have wondered \"what if Hitler had gotten the atomic bomb ahead of us?\" Now we know. Aggressive war is being fought by Russia against an innocent neighbor under the protection of its nuclear umbrella. Putin has threatened the West with nuclear war if they aid Ukraine. Even an attack using battlefield nuclear weapons is a present threat. Despite this threat, the West is openly supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself.\n\nThis risk is one that has to be taken. The decision has been forced upon us. The future consequences for the world of doing nothing have become manifest. Russia has said it is acting in its own defense. That is a lie. Ukraine is not and never was a threat to Russia. NATO is a defensive alliance and not a threat to Russia. Now Russia has proven NATO\u2019s vital necessity. Ukraine is no threat to Russia except in its decision to be a free country. A free Ukraine is an example to the people of Russia themselves as Putin understands.\n\nThe real reason for this invasion of Ukraine is Putin's determination to reassemble the old Soviet empire. Ukraine is Putin\u2019s essential first step. Putin has said that the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th Century. Putin sees his place in history as the leader who reverses that history. This invasion is a play for the big stakes.\n\nAgainst that historic possibility, Putin measured the constant messages of Western weakness: prestige summits, removal of Nord Stream 2 sanctions, a free extension of the New Start Treaty without any demand on Russia, and the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Putin observed no response to the take-over of Crimea, the takeover of parts of Georgia, and a statement by President Biden that \"a minor incursion\" into Ukraine might mean lesser sanctions. All of this invited Putin\u2019s decision to invade to achieve his place in history.\n\nThe attack on Kyiv failed due to heroic resistance by Ukraine and President Zelensky. Now Putin has a backup plan to conquer the Donbas in east Ukraine. When I was Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the organization addressed the issue of armed pro-Russian proxies in Donbas. A principal mission of OSCE is to send hundreds of monitors into Donbas to observe threats of Russian military action and to report. Some OSCE observers lost their lives in order to do so. Now Russia has declared Donbas independent and has launched a further invasion of that long-suffering province of Ukraine.\n\nThis war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine changes everything, not just the security and peace in Europe, but the safety of the entire world, and especially the safety of the United States. The OSCE and the stability of Europe are based on the Helsinki Accords of 1976. Russia signed those accords. The agreement was that aggressive war would be outlawed, that any county could be a part of any alliance or association it chose, and that citizens would have open access to information and travel. Russia deliberately impliedly revoked the Helsinki Accords to further its imperial aspirations.\n\nIf the Russian aggression in Ukraine is successful, the next defense of the West in Europe will be harder and more dangerous. My experience as Ambassador proved to me that the nations of Europe are aware of these dangers. The ambassadors of the member nations of OSCE with whom I interacted made it clear that their countries will defend themselves and welcome American presence, commitment, and leadership.\n\nMy fear is that if Ukraine is conquered by force and terror, Russia will not have to further invade Europe \u2013 perhaps not even Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia, although the threat of a NATO response is clear. The sovereignty of the countries of Europe will be compromised, and they will have to take the Russian threat into account in the conduct of their affairs. Europe will be neutralized. As World War II so clearly demonstrated, America is not safe if Europe is dominated by any hostile power.\n\nI am a lifelong conservative, and a follower of President Ronald Reagan. President Reagan understood the danger of an expansionist Russia. America was safe while he was in the White House. When I speak on foreign affairs, a few fellow conservatives ask, \"What does Ukraine matter to us?\" This strain of neo-isolationism in the American conservative movement must be eradicated. Many wish we could stay at home, and not become involved in the world. That is not the world we live in. Conservatives must lead in this long war to keep our own country safe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe challenge to America goes beyond Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Other authoritarian countries want to remake the world and are preparing for conflict. The 32 years of relative peace following the fall of the Berlin Wall were only a prelude to the long war, perhaps a hundred-year war, in which we now are engaged. Ukraine is only the first battle of that conflict. Taiwan may be next.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe people of the world will be with us, but it is America\u2019s fate to provide strength and leadership.

Even among those who say the country is doing too little to support Ukraine, 57 percent oppose direct military action, something President Biden has said is off the table, repeatedly warning that such a move could lead to \u201cWorld War III.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe findings suggest that Biden\u2019s policies largely reflect Americans\u2019 preferences when it comes to the Russian invasion. Biden has steadily ramped up military and humanitarian assistance to Kyiv \u2014 he asked Congress on Thursday for another $33 billion in such funding \u2014 while regularly tightening sanctions on Moscow. But he has also been quick to stress that he will not send Americans to Ukraine or take other actions, such as implementing a no-fly zone, that could lead to a direct military clash with Russia.\n\nDespite the broad support for sanctions, they have created a political problem for Biden and other Democrats by helping drive up gas prices, and that dynamic is reflected in the poll.\n\nAbout 2 in 3 Americans, or 66 percent, say they are concerned about sanctions contributing to higher food and energy costs at home. The anxiety is bipartisan, with 68 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans saying they are concerned. Gas prices have averaged more than $4 a gallon since the start of March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even among those concerned that sanctions are spurring inflation, 64 percent support increasing them, as do 67 percent of Americans overall.\n\nBiden has tried to prepare the nation for the financial pain stemming from the crisis in Ukraine, blaming it on Russian President Vladimir Putin and citing \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike\u201d whenever he speaks of higher prices at the pump.\n\n\u201cThe cost of this fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen,\u201d Biden said last week in urging more aid to Ukraine. \u201cWe either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country, or we stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities and aggression in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAmericans are widely worried about the conflict escalating, with 81 percent saying they fear that the war will expand into other European countries, 80 percent concerned about U.S. forces getting involved in the fighting and 80 percent concerned about Russia using nuclear weapons. Fifty percent say they are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about nuclear weapons.\n\nThese concerns over the crisis escalating are also bipartisan. More than 8 in 10 Democrats and Republicans are concerned about the war expanding beyond Ukraine and the United States becoming involved in the fighting. Large majorities of both groups are also concerned about Russia using nuclear weapons, though Democrats are somewhat more worried about this (86 percent) than Republicans (72 percent).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApproval for Biden\u2019s handling of the war in the Ukraine \u2014 as well as his handling of the pandemic \u2014 has helped buoy his overall job approval ratings, which increased five points from 37 percent in February to 42 percent in the new poll. Still, Biden remains solidly in negative territory, with 52 percent disapproving of his job performance amid persistent concerns about the economy.\n\nSpecifically, 42 percent of Americans approve of Biden\u2019s handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine, up from 33 percent when Russia launched its invasion just over two months ago. Now, 47 percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of the crisis, the same percent that disapproved in February, while fewer people say they have no opinion.\n\nThe approval for Biden\u2019s handling of the war is largely partisan, with 73 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of independents approving. Only 14 percent of Republicans approved of Biden\u2019s handling of the war, with 76 percent disapproving.\n\nNotably, Biden\u2019s support of his handling of Ukraine and Russia has improved markedly with independents since February, when 30 percent approved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the latest Post-ABC poll did not measure Americans\u2019 reasons for supporting Ukraine, polls in the weeks after Russia\u2019s invasion found a sharp increase in support for sanctions, as well as in negative views toward Russia. A Pew Research Center survey, for instance, found 70 percent said Russia is an enemy rather than a competitor or partner, up from 41 percent who said the same in January.\n\nBiden has repeatedly sought to make the case for U.S. involvement in the distant war, suggesting that he recognizes that support could wane if it drags on too long.\n\n\u201cThroughout our history, we\u2019ve learned that when dictators do not pay the price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and engage in more aggression,\u201d Biden said last week. \u201cThey keep moving, and the costs, the threats to America and the world, keep rising. We can\u2019t let this happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nViews on Ukraine remain remarkably stable across party lines, including among Americans who voted for opposing candidates in the 2020 presidential election, making Ukraine an area of rare bipartisan agreement. Relatively few Republicans have been forcefully critical of Biden on the issue, especially compared with their regular attacks on him over inflation, crime, immigration and other subjects.\n\nOf those who voted for Biden, 64 percent support more military aid for Ukraine, as do 52 percent of those who voted for President Donald Trump. And 83 percent of Americans who voted for Biden support more humanitarian aid for Ukraine, as do 67 percent of Americans who voted for Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden called for a dramatic increase in aid to Ukraine, urging Congress to pass a new $33 billion spending package that includes military and humanitarian aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe request for more aid came at a time when the United States has determined, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put it, that Ukraine \u201ccan win \u2014 they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support.\u201d And it also comes as the fighting shifts to the eastern part of the country for what is expected to be a long slog.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll finds that age is a much greater source of division about U.S. involvement in Ukraine, with younger Americans less supportive of additional actions.\n\nWhile 69 percent of those aged 65 and older support increasing military support, that drops to 54 percent among those aged 40 to 64 and 47 percent among adults younger than 40. Support for increasing military support is particularly low among younger adults who identify or lean Republican: 38 percent support boosting military support to Ukraine, while 52 percent are opposed.",

        "content": "The problem with Russia suffering \u201ccolossal losses\u201d (Moscow confirms attack on Kyiv during UN chief\u2019s visit, 29 April) is that this really does not matter to its leaders. You only have to look back at historic campaigns involving Russia and its satellites to see that one of its major tactics is to keep throwing men (and women) into battle until the other side runs out of steam.\n\nA comparison of the allied (British, American and French) cemeteries from the second world war in what was West Berlin and the Soviet war memorial in Treptow Park in the erstwhile East Berlin shows the difference in attitude to the value of human life: on the one hand individual graves lovingly cared for, each with its cross; on the other a vast arena where a statue of a Russian soldier holds aloft a child and stamps on the symbol of Nazism, while looking across to the statue of Mother Russia. Between them lie anonymous sarcophagi, each containing an unnumbered quantity of unnamed bodies.\n\nWestern rhetoric will not deter Vladimir Putin, who is a past master of the art; our politicians must find an effective brake to his ambitions in order to prevent further aggression from him.\n\nAnne Maclennan\n\nCuguen, France\n\nI was relieved to read your editorial (29 April) explicitly addressing the risks of escalation of the Ukraine war. I have been alarmed at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric of our government, politicians and commentators in the press, which has drifted towards war between Nato and Russia, without any reflection on the risks raised by a conflict between nuclear powers.\n\nAs someone who lived through much of the cold war, I am astonished and terrified by the apparent lack of concern over the risks of this crisis; where alarm bells should be ringing loudly, nuclear escalation is hardly referred to, despite nuclear Armageddon being a predictable consequence. Whereas the priority should be seeking a negotiated end to the conflict involving unpalatable compromises, all the rhetoric has been of victory and defeat. Unless this changes, the risks will only steadily increase.\n\nStephen Smith\n\nGlasgow\n\nAnother brilliant piece by Simon Jenkins (Liz Truss risks recklessly inflaming Ukraine\u2019s war to serve her own ambition, 28 April). With a prime minister who thinks he\u2019s Winston Churchill and a foreign secretary who thinks she\u2019s Margaret Thatcher, we are at risk of bellicose fantasy sliding into bloody reality. Putin is dangerous, but the best response to danger is rationality, not grandiose promises. Putin needs a way out. A joint undertaking by Russia and Nato to guarantee the neutrality of Ukraine (and other nations) should have been on the table to avert the invasion, but it could still be a way of offering Putin a basis for peace. He would no doubt claim it was an achievement of his demonstration of strength, but sustaining sovereignty would be the real benefit. The endgame has to be agreement, not mutually assured destruction.\n\nAndrew Seber\n\nWinchester\n\nNeal Ascherson\u2019s condemnation of Liz Truss\u2019s dangerous rhetoric is clear and welcome (Letters, 28 April). It is founded on deep understanding of the countries and peoples who live near or around the Black Sea. His call for Truss to be put \u201cback into her cage\u201d should be extended to Boris Johnson and Ben Wallace, who dangerously talk up conflict as a solution and themselves as \u201cleaders\u201d.\n\nDarra McFadyen\n\nLondon\n\nMany international lawyers argue that Nato is an illegal organisation since it is a political and military alliance, not exclusively focused on peace and security, although it signed up to article 2(4) of the UN charter prohibiting use of force to resolve disputes. Liz Truss ignores its peace role and is promoting the continuance of this horrendous war, rather than seeking ways to end it.\n\nMargaret Owen\n\nLondon",

        "content": "Russia needs to stop being a threat: to its neighbours, to its own people, to the world. Minimising that threat should be the goal of our policies and the only way to face up to the reality of the Kremlin\u2019s boot stamping on so many faces. The hope that the current iteration of Russia is ready to recognise that other states have rights is gone. Putin\u2019s Russia is not an ordinary country seeking some rational security guarantees. It\u2019s a predator that works according to its own logic of internal oppression and external aggression. With such a state there is no going back to \u201cnormal\u201d. No clever \u201cdeal\u201d that can be cut to restore previous relations.\n\nAs we work out what minimising Russia\u2019s threat means in practice, we may also get to something bigger: a set of security, humanitarian and economic interconnections that redefine how we reduce aggression in an interconnected age. Russia\u2019s aim in its invasion of Ukraine was to reset the world order, tilt it towards dictatorships, impunity and the right of great powers to crush the small. Instead, it may produce a desire to strengthen rights, sovereignty and democracy. In pushing for the worst, it might produce something better.\n\nThe first place where Russia\u2019s threat has to be minimised is in Ukraine itself. This will be achieved on the battlefield. Ukraine is still vastly outnumbered in both men and arms. The situation in the Donbas is tenuous. Every day, about 100 Ukrainian soldiers are killed. And it\u2019s no longer hardened professional fighters \u2013 it\u2019s IT specialists, sociologists, students.\n\nWhen I met President Zelenskiy, together with colleagues from the Atlantic magazine a few weeks ago, his greatest fear was that the victory in the battle for Kyiv meant that too many people would think the war over when it was just shifting to a different, more deadly phase in the Donbas. The world\u2019s attention has faded. Allies are being slow to arm Ukraine sufficiently. Positions are being ceded daily because of a lack of basic munitions for artillery. This needs to change fast. Any eventual negotiations have to be taken from a position of Ukrainian strength, not weakness, or else they risk being another deal that gives up all the leverage to Russia, only augmenting the threat it poses.\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine in 2022 because, after its 2014 invasion, Putin thought he could get away with it\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be worried about \u201chumiliating\u201d Putin and his henchmen on the battlefield \u2013 humiliation in Russian politics and society comes from within, centuries of not dealing with a history of repression and mass murder has produced a political culture that seethes with resentment and fear. All that can be done is encourage Russian elites and society to face up to the reality and the limits of their power. It\u2019s up to us whether negotiations \u2013 if and when they happen \u2013 take place in the far east with Russia exhausted \u2013 or at the gates of Kyiv, with Russia ascendant.\n\nIf and when those negotiations happen, Ukraine has to be armed to the teeth to deter future Russian incursions. It is also hoping for security guarantees, including from the UK. But there\u2019s a greater context here too. The Russian invasion is relevant to any nation that lives unprotected in the neighbourhood of nuclear bullies: think Moldova, Georgia and the central Asian states around Russia; Japan, Australia and Taiwan around China. It\u2019s no coincidence that Australia, a country that could have chosen to sit out this conflict, has been such an enthusiastic advocate of the Ukrainian cause, even providing $70m-worth of defensive equipment.\n\nHow can you protect such countries from aggression, given they are not Nato members and the nuclear status of the states that threaten them? The ad hoc support to Ukraine gives us a clue: a mix of economic warfare and provision of arms. But to act as a deterrent this threat has to be made clear and be coordinated before any invasion. Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022 because, after its 2014 invasion, Putin thought he could get away with it. The moment sanctions kick in should not be up for debate: a war of aggression should trigger harsh measures.\n\nMoreover, we need to tie crimes against humanity to even more aggressive sanctions. The indiscriminate bombing of Mariupol or slaughter in Bucha should lead to oil embargoes. We need to reconnect humanitarian norms to economics.\n\nAll talk about \u201cregime change\u201d from outside is foolish: Russia is a great power no one can influence or attack that brazenly\n\nSo far, the economic power dynamics lie the other way. At the moment, a country such as Australia, which criticised Beijing\u2019s human rights record, is bullied by China with grain sanctions. Russia holds the world hostage to hunger by limiting its own grain exports and blocking Ukraine\u2019s, demanding sanctions against Russia are lifted. In central Europe, a gruesome calculation is emerging: what hike in gas prices are people willing to bear before they close their eyes to Putin\u2019s crimes against humanity? Everywhere, human rights are subservient to economic needs. For us to rein in the aggression of the Russias and Chinas of this world, it needs to be the other way round.\n\nWhile such measures can act as a deterrent, Russia will also have to change internally before it stops being a threat. Can we ever hope for a Russia that is ready to give up imperial pretensions, live in harmony with its neighbours and even establish rule of law at home? It seems a far-off dream. All talk about \u201cregime change\u201d from outside is foolish: Russia is a great power no one can influence or attack that brazenly. But what we can do is remain steadfast in our sanctions and commitment to indicting war criminals, showing Russian elites that their punishment is long and serious. Anecdotal research from inside the country suggests many think the sanctions will be lifted soon. This betrays great weakness. In his memoirs of life in Nazi concentration camps, the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl noted that those who thought their imprisonment would end soon were in denial of reality \u2013 and the first to then break and collapse.\n\nWho will communicate this? Currently, we are not explaining the meaning and intent of sanctions and western policy to the Russian people. If they are perceived purely as random and poorly motivated economic weapons, this will actually risk strengthening the cleaving of Russian society to the state. People bunch together when faced with what they claim, rightly or wrongly, is an unjustified attack. However, if they are shown to be part of a more values-based rejection of Russia from the global community, somewhat like South Africa under apartheid, then they will act as a way to undermine Russians\u2019 connection to their own leadership. It\u2019s no wonder that Kremlin propaganda is always celebrating any cracks in western resolve towards Russia: from Tucker Carlson\u2019s pro-Russian diatribes through to Italian and French \u201cpeace\u201d proposals favourable to Moscow. The Kremlin knows many Russians don\u2019t want to feel completely isolated and rejected from the world.\n\nWe have launched a form of economic warfare, without backing it up with advocacy and engagement. This is absurd, allowing the Kremlin to manage perceptions. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to get Russians\u2019 attention. A short video from Arnold Schwarzenegger directed at his Russian fans and condemning the war got millions of views. The Russian internet firewall is feeble: you can still use radio, WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube. The more understanding there is that the Kremlin has led people into a dead end, that this is permanent, the more impetus there is for elites to change the direction of the country.\n\nPeter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: Adventures in Modern Russia",

For 100 days, Russia has been continually and indiscriminately bombarding Ukrainian military forces and civilians. France stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people in their suffering. It has done so not only since February 24, but since 2014, which saw the illegal annexation of Crimea and the eruption of the conflict in the Donbas. There can be no impunity whatsoever for the atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine \u2013 in Bucha and other cities,\u201d reads the statement by Catherine Colonna, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, on the 100th day of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe minister noted that she had conveyed \u201ca message of friendship and admiration to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people\u201d during her recent visit to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI reaffirmed France\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, evidenced by the humanitarian, economic, financial, diplomatic and military aid France provides to that country, which we intend to increase and continue in the long term.

as they say - help in creating a program for next year's elections.- People, as you can see, react enthusiastically - said after the meeting in Sochaczew PiS vice -meter Rados\u0142aw Fogiel.\n\nIn Sochaczew, enthusiasm was trained.Before Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski's speech, the participants of the meeting practiced cries in honor of the PiS president.Sylwester Kaczmarek, chairman of the Sochaczew City Council, instructed the residents from the stage.\"We have to really chad here to remember us,\" he said.\n\nParty conventions are always directed to some extent, and the shouts are carefully planned, but it was supposed to be a meeting with voters, and even for voters protesting in front of the building there was not enough.\n\nAfter the salvos of applause and shouts, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski could start his speech.In the context of Russian aggression in Ukraine, the PiS president said: We must do everything to avoid war with us.\n\n- In this way to be very difficult to attack, we just have to arm ourselves - said Kaczy\u0144ski.\n\nThen the German thread appeared in the speech.- Anyway, when we said that we would be seriously armed, the Germans said they too.So this mechanism was launched.Whether Germans want to arm against Russia or against us, I don't know, but in any case armor - said PiS president.\n\nThe opposition asks if it was to be an unfortunate joke, and adds that the deputy prime minister for security seems to suggest that our neighbor, our partner from the European Union and NATO armor against Poland.\n\n- Either he does it cynically to arouse more anti -German moods, or just out of stupidity.I don't know what is worse - says Borys Budka, MP of Platforma Obywatelska.- Calling artificial phobias and looking for an enemy where he is not there - adds Dariusz Klimczak, MP of the Polish People's Party.\n\nSearching for an enemy?\n\n- The enemy is in the east - says the opposition, and looking for it at the moment behind our western border is unreasonable, because the German army is a serious element in a NATO puzzle.\n\n- If there were a potential - which threatens us, because it can happen - Russia's aggression on Poland, it is this German component that should, as part of the North Atlantic Alliance, fight with us with the invader - notes Marek Biernacki, MP of the Polish -PSL coalition..\n\nHowever, PiS politicians are of a different opinion.\n\n- Maybe I am allergic, but when I hear about the fact that the Germans are starting to arm, I do not feel comfortable - said Law and Justice MP Marek Suski in an interview with Radio Plus, noting that the Germans have already attacked Poland once.\n\nThe topic of war reparations\n\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski during the speech in Sochaczew also raised the topic of war reparations from Germany.- They did not settle accounts for us from World War II - said the deputy prime minister.\n\nIn addition, the PiS president said that now there is a good opportunity to apply to Berlin for reparations.- There is something like timing in politics, the moment when you have to perform with some demands, this right moment is probably approaching, that you have to chop your fist on the table - said Kaczy\u0144ski.\n\nOpposition politicians remind, however, that the PiS president promised reparations seven years ago.Even the Sejm team and the Government Institute of War Loss were created.Half a year ago we heard that estimation of losses is \"at the finish\".\n\nNow MP Marek Suski says that the team's work \"has been completed\".- Today we can say, a report.At this point, you will have to use this report.I think it is closer than further - the politician added.\n\nThe topic of reparations is not the first for PiS.- This topic always comes back.When Law and Justice has a crisis, he tries to find an enemy - says Marek Biernacki from the Polish -PSL coalition.\n\nThe opposition emphasizes that diplomatic relations with Germany, especially in the situation of conflict in Ukraine, must be particularly constructive.\n\n- Of course, you can have reservations about many matters related to how Germany pursue their energy policy, how their policy against Ukraine pursues, but you cannot lead to conflicts between us and Germany - believes Magdalena Biejat, a left of the left.\n\nIn the talks of Warsaw with the new German government, the topic of reparations appeared, but there was no official conclusion so far.\n\nAuthor: Maria Bili\u0144ska / Source: Facts in the afternoon TVN24",

In 1939, Russia and Stalin invaded another neighbor, Finland, and they too believed they could be victorious in just a few days. Like today\u2019s conflict, the world was shocked by how the Finnish fought off Russia. A new FOX Nation documentary, The Winter War, examines how the 1939 conflict foreshadowed the current aggression against Ukraine.

A majority across the 10 countries felt governments should sever economic and cultural relations with Moscow, with most \u2013 rising to 71% in Poland \u2013 also favouring an end to diplomatic ties.\n\nSimilarly, 58% across the 10 countries \u2013 rising to 77% in Finland \u2013 wanted the EU to reduce its dependence on Russian energy, even at the expense of the bloc\u2019s climate goals, suggesting public support for a new round of EU sanctions, including on oil.\n\nBut ECFR\u2019s polling showed a clear divide between Europeans who want peace as soon as possible (35% across the 10 countries), and those who want justice \u2013 defined as restoring Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and holding Russia to account (22%).\n\nA third \u201cswing\u201d group, who share the anti-Russian feelings of justice supporters but also the peace camp\u2019s fears of escalation, accounted for about 20% of voters, the report found \u2013 with major distribution differences between countries.\n\nThe peace camp \u2013 whose backers also tended to believe Ukraine would be worse off than Russia at the end of the conflict \u2013 was most strongly supported in Italy (52%), the polling found, while Poland had the biggest justice camp, at 41%.\n\nCrucially, views on the EU\u2019s policy response to the invasion varied depending on which camp respondents were in, with justice voters backing the severance of economic, diplomatic and cultural ties, and peace voters supporting only the first of these.\n\nAsked what worried them most about the war, respondents in Germany, Italy and France were most concerned about the cost of living and energy prices, while respondents in Sweden, the UK and Poland were most concerned about the threat of nuclear war.\n\nAs the conflict drags on and costs grow, governments will increasingly be forced to \u201cbalance the pursuit of European unity with opinions that diverge both within and among member states\u201d, the authors write, pointing to a \u201cgrowing gap between the positions of many governments and the public mood in their respective countries\u201d.",

Even if the costs are high, not only for military support, but also because of the high energy and food prices.\"\n\nBoris Johnson wrote in the \"Sunday Times\" newspaper after his second visit to Kiev on Friday, that Western allies should \"prepare ourselves for a long war, as Putin resorted to a campaign of attrition, in an attempt to crush Ukraine with absolute brutality.\"\n\nJohnson said that the seizure of the Ukrainian region, which covers most of the eastern Ukraine, has been the goal of Putin over the past eight years \"when he ignited a separatist rebellion and launched his first invasion.\"\n\nWhile Russia was still lacking this goal, \"Putin may not realize this, but its great imperial plan to restore the full restoration of Ukraine has gone out of its path. In his isolation, he may still believe that the full invasion is possible.\"\n\nThe two men stressed the need to avoid any Russian aggression in the future.\n\nStoltenberg said: \"If Putin learns the lesson from this war that he can continue in it as he did after the Georgia War in 2008 and occupy the Crimea in 2014, we will pay a much higher price,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nJohnson asked what would happen if President Putin was free to keep all regions of Ukraine under the control of Russian forces now.Johnson said: \"What if no one is ready to raise his finger when he included this occupied land and its fearful people to Greater Russia? Will this peace be achieved?\"\n\n\"We and our allies will protect our security as much as Ukraine protects and protect the world from Putin's deadly dreams and those who may seek to imitate it,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson wrote: \"Time is the vital factor. Everything will depend on whether Ukraine can enhance its ability to defend its lands faster than Russia's ability to renew its ability to attack. Our mission is to devote time to Ukraine.\"\n\nUkrainian officials said on Sunday that the violent fighting continues in the city of Sevirodontsk - the center of the bloody battle in the East Dunbas region of Ukraine - and the surrounding societies where Russian forces are trying to break the resistance of Ukrainian defenders and seize parts of the East Logansk, the area they already control.\n\nDuring the arrival of Western weapons systems, Ukrainian President Voludimir Zellinski warned this week that the Ukrainian army needs to come faster as Russia accumulates a large artillery feature around the two cities in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAmerican officials insist that Western weapons are still flowing to the front lines of the fighting.But local reports on deficiency of weapons - and the improved calls by Ukrainian officials on the front lines - have raised questions about the effectiveness of operating supply lines.\n\nThe Biden Administration announced on Wednesday that it will provide an additional billion dollars as military aid to Ukraine, a package that includes additional shipments of the Hauteer and ammunition and coastal defense systems.While the United Kingdom \"plans to work with our friends to prepare Ukrainian forces to defend their country, with the possibility of training up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days,\" Johnson said.\n\nWhile Russia was achieving increasing gains in eastern Ukraine, Johnson stressed the depletion of Russian forces in the fierce battles, saying that Russia would need \"years, and perhaps contracts, to replace these devices. An hour by an hour, Russian forces spend the equipment and ammunition faster than their factories can produce\".\n\nAt the end of this week, Zellinski visited the front lines in the coastal city of Odessa and the southern city of Miklav, both Russian goal in trying to seize the Black Sea coast.\n\nJohnson added that the Russian blockade of the Black Sea ports means that \"25 million tons of corn and wheat - the full annual consumption of all the least developed countries - stacked in silos throughout Ukraine.\"\n\nOn the upcoming NATO summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said that the concept of a new strategy will be adopted, \"He will announce that Russia is no longer a partner, but it is a threat to our security, peace and stability.\"\n\nHe said, \"The Russian nuclear swords are dangerous and irresponsible. Putin should know that it is not possible to triumph in a nuclear war and should not be launched at all.\"",

The MPs noted that, unfortunately, we still have a lot of formalism on this front, and therefore we have also made certain decisions. The most important decision is that our programs, which we will adopt further, should be focused on import substitution and avoidance of economic dependence on the unfriendly states,\" Vladimir Andreichenko emphasized. \u201cThe third important line of work is countering the hybrid aggression waged against Belarus and Russia today, preserving the historical memory of the Great Patriotic War. We have mapped out the programs for the near future. I believe that the session was held in a positive, constructive manner.\"\n\nThe session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Belarus-Russia Union State was running in Minsk on 20 June. The Union State parliamentarians discussed efforts to counter external challenges and threats, sanctions, promulgation of Nazism, and efforts to protect historical memory.

In recent months, the Western alliance has shown signs of strain and fatigue.\n\nSome voices - particularly in France, Germany and Italy - have asked if it might not be better for the war to end, even if it came at the cost of Ukraine having to cede territory. A recent cross-Europe opinion poll, external suggested some voters put solving the cost-of-living crisis ahead of punishing Russia.\n\nOthers argue about the need to salvage some kind of relationship with Russia in the future.\n\nCountries like the UK, Poland and the three Baltic States have been resisting these arguments, saying that any peace deal with Moscow that is not on Ukraine's terms would lead to further Russian aggression in the future. President Zelensky is likely to reinforce this argument when he addresses the summit virtually on Monday.\n\nSo the G7 leaders are expected to try to use the summit to clear these muddy waters, promising more weapons to Ukraine and more sanctions against Russia. The idea will be to send a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West has the strategic patience to maintain its support for Ukraine, even if it faces domestic political pressure at home from voters concerned about rising prices.\n\nThe problem for G7 leaders is they also face growing pressure to show they are tackling the global economic crisis. The soaring price of fuel and food is causing hunger and unrest across the world. And some countries are pointing the finger at the West.\n\nMany countries in the global south do not share Western concerns about Russian aggression. They see the conflict as a European war and seem unmoved by Western arguments that Vladimir Putin is acting as a colonial aggressor. And they blame Western sanctions - as much as Russia's invasion - for the rising costs of gas and oil, and the massive shortage of wheat and fertiliser.",

        "content": "At the Nato summit in Madrid this week sweeping changes to the western military alliance were agreed by leaders, including a huge increase in the number of troops deployed in Europe.\n\nAbout 300,000 troops across the continent will be placed at high readiness from next year in case Russia threatens a military attack on any member of the alliance, and Finland and Sweden will be formally invited to join.\n\nExtra forces to be allocated specific allies to defend\n\nExisting Nato defences on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank will be increased to the size of a brigade \u2013 about 3,000 to 5,000 troops in addition to local forces.\n\nBritain will commit an extra 1,000 UK-based troops and one of its two new aircraft carriers to the defence of Estonia, where Britain already has about 1,700 personnel deployed. Joe Biden, the US president, announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain.\n\nHeavy equipment positioned near borders with Russia\n\nJens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, explained that the new strategy meant heavy equipment would be positioned near Nato borders, with the ability to rapidly move people into place to use it. Before the summit, Estonia\u2019s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, had claimed that existing Nato defence plans would give Russia the time to wipe Tallinn off the map before western troops could be mobilised. During the summit, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, admitted it would have taken 60 days to move extra tanks to the Baltic states in the event of a conflict under the old plans.\n\nRussia identified as main threat to Nato\n\nA 2022 Nato strategic concept document was published, which identified Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as the driving force behind the changes. It was the first time the document had been revised since 2010, when Russia still attended Nato summits. It states: \u201cThe Russian Federation\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine has shattered peace and gravely altered our security environment. Its brutal and unlawful invasion, repeated violations of international humanitarian law and heinous attacks and atrocities have caused unspeakable suffering and destruction.\u201d\n\nFinland and Sweden formally invited to join\n\nA deal agreed between Finland, Sweden and Turkey cleared the way for the formal invitation of the two Nordic states into the alliance. That signalled the end of the two countries\u2019 traditional neutrality, which dated back to the cold war \u2013 and in Sweden\u2019s case before that. Turkey\u2019s objections were dropped after reaching a deal in which the two Nordic countries vowed to take steps to control support for Kurdish terrorism. Their membership has to be ratified individually by the parliaments of all 30 existing allies.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BST\n\nDefence spending\n\nNato\u2019s target that 2% of GDP of each country be spent on defence will in the future be seen as \u201cmore of a floor than a ceiling\u201d said Stoltenberg. But although Downing Street agreed the 2% target was outdated, it said there needed to be a \u201creality check\u201d on existing commitments to spend above inflation every year in the parliament. Wallace, however, called for greater investment after 2025. \u201cAs the threat changes, so must the funding,\u201d he said.\n\nAn eye to China\n\nThe Nato document states that China\u2019s \u201cmalicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target allies\u201d and that China\u2019s \u201cstated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values\u201d.

        "content": "After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sometimes looked like an alliance in search of a purpose. After this week\u2019s Nato summit in Madrid, that charge is harder to sustain. Nato provided the structure for emergency western efforts to support Ukraine following Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion in February. Four months on, the alliance has now put that on a more long-term footing, with major financial, strategic and regional consequences. Yet important uncertainties still remain.\n\nNato\u2019s repurposing has four elements. The first is strategic \u2013 recognising that attempts to form a cooperative relationship with Russia have ended for the foreseeable future, and that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, inexcusable in itself, also marks a wider confrontation with the west. The second is the reversal of the post-1989 era of declining defence budgets. This has now been replaced by an expanded deterrence marked by aid to Ukraine, higher military spending for the coming decade and a sevenfold increase in the number of Nato troops on high alert to reach 300,000.\n\nThe third element is a partial U-turn on European deployments by the US. America\u2019s pivot to the Pacific, confronting the rise of China, has not been abandoned, but President Biden is now authorising the largest scaling up of the US military presence in Europe since the cold war. Significantly, most of this American scaling up will be in the east of our continent, with a new headquarters in Poland, 5,000 additional troops in Romania and more intense deployments in the Baltic states.\n\nFinally, Nato has expanded its membership, formally inviting Sweden and Finland \u2013 the latter has an 800-mile land border with Russia \u2013 to join the alliance. This ends more than 70 years of neutrality by the two Nordic nations. It is a sign of how decisively the Ukraine invasion has destroyed wider trust towards Russia. But it has huge military implications in the Baltic. It was only achieved after Turkey, a more than usually crucial Nato member during the current conflict, lifted its earlier veto, perhaps amid promises that the US would soon supply it with enhanced F-16 fighters jets.\n\nThese are major changes. Russian aggression has pushed the west across a big policy watershed. However, in some ways this is also a return to a once familiar security landscape. It finds Nato, in effect, embarking on a new cold war mission. It marks, potentially, the birth of a new era of collective western deterrence of Russian power. The implications for domestic and international politics should not be underestimated. But the world \u2013 and the Europe \u2013 of the 2020s is very different from that of the late 1940s.\n\nWhether the new Nato strategy will unfold in a similar manner to the cold war, perhaps for the same length of time and with the same ultimate success, is unknowable. Much depends on what happens on the battlefield in the coming months. The democracies will all face big dilemmas about spending priorities and military commitments. A change of administration in Washington could transform the outlook radically, leaving Europe struggling to maintain sufficient support, and tempting Russia to simply sit the confrontation out.\n\nIt is important not to exaggerate, especially prematurely. Yet this is a permanent problem for Britain. Words and pledges are not the same as plans, outputs, deployments, training and spending. Much of what was agreed in Madrid will take years to come into effect, if at all. Boris Johnson and some ministers who are manoeuvring to replace him are showboaters whose inflated language is aimed solely at the Tory party. Threats against China, of the kind that Liz Truss made this week, are an example. Defending Ukraine and deterring Russia are more than enough to be getting on with.",

However, Russia's war against Ukraine may be long as a \"conflict freeze\u201d cannot be ruled out at a certain point.\n\nThat\u2019s according to ex-President of Poland (1995-2005) Alexander Kwasniewski, who spoke in an interview with Ukrinform.\n\nThe former Polish leader emphasized that he never had any illusions that Putin wants to take all of Ukraine under his control, not just a third of the country. As early as 2002, Kwasniewski recalls, Putin told him about his strategic goal \u2013 the reconstruction of Greater Russia, which the ex-president noted is difficult to imagine without Ukraine. Therefore, in the following years, he was aware that it was due to this that Russia exerted political and economic pressure, applied gas blackmail, and obstructed the signing of the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement.\n\n\"However, I sincerely admit: it seemed to me that Putin is a pragmatist so he would not attack Ukraine, because that would look like madness. But he went for it anyway. Putin made a historic mistake, the price of which will be huge for Russia,\" Kwasniewski emphasized.\n\nAccording to the former Polish leader, Russia's war against Ukraine may be a long one. On the one hand, Putin does not want to lose the war, so he will continue his aggression with varying intensity.\n\n\"On the other hand, Ukraine cannot surrender as Ukraine is now convinced of its rightness, it\u2019s fighting for its land, for its rights, for the safety of its people. If the West is going to help, and it has pledged to do so, especially militarily, it should provide as many weapons as needed, and more. Taken this all into account, it means that the war could be long and exhausting,\" Kwasniewski emphasized.\n\nHe admitted that it is difficult for him to imagine a turning point in the war when both sides will be ready to make concessions and sit down at the negotiating table.\n\n\"I don\u2019t believe that Putin is ready to make concessions and return to the pre-February 24 situation in conditions where Russia already has its presence in the south, when he opened a corridor to Crimea and gained control over the Sea of \u200b\u200bAzov and Mariupol. At the same time, I cannot imagine any Ukrainian politician who would start talking about any territorial concessions to Russia. Therefore, a peaceful solution to the problem is completely impossible today,\" Kwasniewski noted.\n\nInstead, he does not rule out a \"conflict freeze at a certain point,\" which is not very good news.\n\n\"But if both sides, especially the Russians, admit that they have exhausted their power and forces, and need time to recover, then some truce initiative may appear. Given the depletion of resources, forces and means, it can also be accepted by the Ukrainian side. But we know what a frozen conflict is. In such conditions, it is difficult to develop or have any far-reaching plans, because today the conflict is frozen, and tomorrow it could be unfrozen. Of all the scenarios, this one seems to be the most possible one,\" the ex-president of Poland stated.\n\nHe emphasized that, as of today, he sees no chance of a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, which would be guaranteed by the most prominent world powers.\n\nSince February 24, Russia has been waging a full-scale war against Ukraine.",

        "content": "Turkey is hosting talks on Wednesday to try and break the deadlock surrounding the export of grain shipments from Ukraine.\n\nMilitary representatives from Turkey, Russia and Ukraine are meeting with a UN delegation to discuss the \u201csafe shipment of grain waiting in Ukrainian ports to international markets by sea,\" Turkish Minister of National Defense Hulusi Akar said on Tuesday.\n\nEurope's breadbasket\n\nWhile the conflict remains confined to within Ukraine\u2019s borders, the impact it is having on food security is truly global.\n\nThe Black Sea basin is one of the world\u2019s most important areas for grain and agricultural production, according to the World Food Programme. As such the consequences of the conflict have increased pressure on resources and access to food for countries all over the world.\n\nKnown as the \u201cbreadbasket of Europe,\" Ukraine was the fifth largest exporter of wheat onto the global market last year. According to a report published by the World Food Programme (WFP) earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s export capacity is now around a sixth of what it was before the war.\n\nThe WFP said it is \u201cclosely coordinating with key actors (EU member states and IFIs) on ways to optimize the export of grain from Ukraine using all options: road, rail, river and sea.\u201d\n\nLast month the WFP warned that the \u201cripple effects\u201d of the conflict would \u201cpush millions of people in countries across the world into poverty and hunger.\u201d\n\nThe crisis is having a devastating impact on impoverished countries such as Egypt and Somalia, which get around 80% and 90% respectively of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine and have seen huge price increases since the start of the conflict.\n\nThe report published by the WFP and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on June 6 said that \u201cthe war in Ukraine has exacerbated the already steadily rising food and energy prices worldwide, which are already affecting economic stability across all regions.\u201d\n\nThe invasion\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion on February 24 came after the winter crop of wheat was planted, meaning it is now ready to harvest. But the agricultural industry has been crippled by numerous factors.\n\nMillions of Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, which has massive implications for manpower. Meanwhile the farmers that remain face numerous challenges. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Moscow of engaging in scorched earth tactics which have destroyed vast quantities of crops, storage and machinery, while there is also the danger of unexploded missiles and ordnance that scatter the fields.\n\nDozens of silos and some of the biggest export terminals have been destroyed by Russian bombardment. One of the largest -- in the southern city of Mykolaiv -- contained some 250,000 tons of grain before being burned in June.\n\nAdditionally, some analysts say there are challenges in obtaining diesel fuel because of the destruction of refineries, meaning some crops cannot be harvested.\n\nRussia has blockaded Black Sea ports, meaning grain already harvested cannot be exported internationally. The UN has said that the blockade has already raised global food prices and threatens to cause a catastrophic food shortage in parts of the world.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Infrastructure Ministry, around 80% of Ukraine\u2019s grain was exported from its Black Sea ports before the invasion. Now exports exit the country exclusively through the Danube River, access to which was made possible after Ukrainian forces retook Snake Island from Russian forces in June. Ukraine is hoping to speed up exports via this route.\n\nUkraine has also accused Russia of removing supplies by stealth and passing them off as Russian grain. Russian operators are transferring grain at sea in an apparent effort to disguise its origin, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN, and merchant ships are turning off their transponders. Russia has repeatedly denied stealing grain or blocking ports.\n\nSome of what would have been Ukrainian produce is now in territory held by the Russians and their allies in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR). The leader of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, said recently that the wheat harvest there would be much higher than in 2021.\n\nWhat are the aims of the talks?\n\nSpecific details have not yet been released. However Reuters has spoken to unnamed diplomats who have suggested that elements of the plan under discussion include Ukrainian vessels guiding grain ships in and out through mined port waters; Russia agreeing to a truce while shipments move; and Turkey -- supported by the United Nations -- inspecting ships to allay Russian fears of weapons smuggling.\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry on Tuesday stressed the role of the United Nations in the talks and the need for \"a solution that will guarantee the security of the southern regions of our country,\" spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko told Reuters.\n\nReporting from Tim Lister, Petro Zadorozhnyy, Vasco Cotovio and Isil Sariyuce",

Then it all stopped. And here such primitive things are thrown in again. It seems that the occupiers are even running out of ammunition of lies \u2013 they are unable to come up with anything new.\n\nThe existing potential for all forms of Russian aggression will certainly be exhausted as well, including for offensive actions on the front and terror against our cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will do everything to speed it up. And this is exactly what we emphasize in all contacts with our partners.\n\nToday, the Russian army again shelled the Saltivka district of Kharkiv with rocket artillery \u2013 purely civilian objects. Residential building, trade pavilions, public transport. As of this time, three people are known to have died, and more than twenty people are on the list of wounded.\n\nThe occupiers also fired at the Slovyansk community in Donbas with \u201cUragans\u201d and hit Kramatorsk with \u201cIskanders\u201d.\n\nAnd each of these Russian strikes is an argument for Ukraine to receive more HIMARS and other modern and effective weapons. Each of these shelling occasions only strengthens our desire to defeat the occupiers \u2013 it will certainly happen.\n\nA few months ago, our expert group chaired by Yermak and McFaul suggested recognizing Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine as genocide. And here is the first real result of the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States \u2013 Senators Risch, Cardin, Wicker, Blumenthal, Portman, Shaheen and Graham presented a draft resolution on recognition of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine as genocide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe resolution states that Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, which include forced deportation to Russia and the targeted killing of Ukrainian civilians during mass atrocities, are genocide against the people of Ukraine. The senators introduced the resolution shortly after Olena delivered an address directly to the US Congress.\n\nAccording to the draft document, the US Senate condemns Russia for committing acts of genocide against the people of Ukraine; calls on the United States, together with NATO and EU allies, to support the government of Ukraine to prevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people; supports tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold Russian political leaders and military personnel accountable for war of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nWith all its terrorist attacks against Ukrainians and our country, Russia is only burying itself.\n\nIn the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 186 combatants were awarded state awards.\n\nEternal gratitude to all who fight for Ukraine!\n\nGlory to Ukraine!",

        "content": "The CEO of Ukrainian energy giant Naftogaz has slammed Canada\u2019s recent decision to undermine sanctions by agreeing to return a gas pipeline turbine to Russia.\n\nSpeaking to the Atlantic Council, Yuriy Vitrenko condemned the move as a \u201cdisturbing\u201d example of Western leaders succumbing to Kremlin blackmail and warned that it would only serve to encourage further Russian aggression.\n\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM! Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\n\u201cThe turbine was not critical, and this was confirmed by the German government. Putin also had other options to send gas if he wanted to via Poland or by sending more gas through the Ukrainian transit system. Clearly, Putin was blackmailing, getting Europe to accede to his demands to test their resolve and see how firm they are in keeping commitments to punish Russia for its crimes,\u201d Vitrenko comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoscow claimed to need the turbine for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which connects Russia to Germany across the Baltic Sea and accounts for more than one-third of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union. In early July, Moscow halted gas deliveries via the pipeline citing maintenance while warning that it could not guarantee future deliveries due to exceptional circumstances. Putin also recently suggested Europe\u2019s mounting energy crisis could be resolved by commissioning the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\n\nThe controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline was built in order to bypass the established Ukrainian gas transit system and prepare the ground for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. These security concerns led to US sanctions on the pipeline in 2020. However, sanctions measures were subsequently lifted in early 2021 by US President Joe Biden at the request of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Germany suspended certification of Nord Stream 2.\n\nWith Putin now increasingly looking to weaponize gas supplies in his struggle to undermine European support for Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has pre-emptively rolled out an emergency plan requiring European nations to cut back natural gas consumption by 15 percent this winter. \u201cRussia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon. And therefore, in any event, whether it\u2019s a partial major cutoff of Russian gas or total cutoff of Russian gas, Europe needs to be ready,\u201d she commented on July 20.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVitrenko is convinced Putin will shut down gas supplies completely in the coming months if he thinks he can gain more concessions from European leaders, such as the lowering or removal of some sanctions. \u201cPutin will try to use this as leverage on Europe because he still believes he can make European leaders accept his demands and hand Ukraine over to him.\u201d\n\nWhile Russia has a strong position on European energy markets, Vitrenko points out that Putin does not enjoy a complete stranglehold over Europe. The continent has been lining up energy alternatives since August 2021 when Russia first began reducing gas volumes in apparent preparation for the coming full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cIf Putin completely cuts off gas exports to Europe it will be a difficult situation but not fatal,\u201d says the Naftogaz CEO. \u201cPrices will be high, people will have to save gas and energy, but nobody will die.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVitrenko acknowledges that Putin can still count on strong support from the German business community but questions whether this justifies the reluctance of so many German politicians to confront the Kremlin. \u201cPutin still has leverage because big German industry is afraid of losses and they are the major sponsors of German politicians. Why are they so concerned about a gas cut off? Maybe the world can live without profits in Germany for one year.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vitrenko, this is likely to be Putin\u2019s last winter with enormous energy leverage over Europe because other sources will be in place by next year. These alternatives are set to include expanded Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) facilities, greater coal options, and more nuclear power. The newly announced Azerbaijani natural gas deal with Europe is another very encouraging step toward diversification away from Russia, he notes. \u201cEveryone knew Azerbaijan could increase its gas volumes. It just needed more compressors to double its capacity. Going forward, Turkmenistan will also be connected to the pipeline and it has huge reserves of natural gas.\u201d\n\nVitrenko is convinced that if Putin thinks Europe is weak, he will escalate his energy war along with the ongoing military invasion of Ukraine until the West finally accedes to his demands. The Naftogaz CEO warns that any concessions offered to the Kremlin will inevitably be interpreted as signs of weakness. \u201cPutin continues pushing the envelope and so far it is working. He will go on raising the stakes and engaging in larger scale blackmail. This is why it is so important to increase rather than decrease sanctions pressure on Russia. We must work together and not let Putin believe he has the upper hand. European leaders need to act as adults and recognize that Putin declared war on them long ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead the original article via Atlantic Council\u2019s Ukraine Alert here.",

        "content": "Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, is arriving in Uganda on the latest stop of his tour of Africa, aimed at rallying support on the continent for Russia as the war in Ukraine goes into its sixth month.\n\nMany African leaders have refused to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and have accused the US and Nato of starting or prolonging the conflict.\n\nBut hundreds of millions on the continent are facing rising food prices and, in some cases, a severe shortage because the blockade of Ukrainian ports by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet is trapping tens of millions of tonnes of grain, dramatically exacerbating existing supply chain problems.\n\nLavrov is seeking to convince African leaders and, to a much lesser extent, ordinary people that Moscow cannot be blamed either for the conflict or the food crisis. Russia has blamed the blockade on Ukrainian mines.\n\nBut Moscow\u2019s efforts to win friends and influence people across Africa go back well beyond recent events. The results of this campaign have been patchy, and Russia remains a marginal player by most conventional benchmarks, such as trade and investment.\n\nLavrov has hailed what he called \u201can independent path\u201d taken by African countries in refusing to join western sanctions against Russia and the \u201cundisguised attempts of the US and their European satellites to gain the upper hand and impose a unipolar world order\u201d.\n\nMoscow was encouraged when the UN general assembly voted on a resolution condemning Russia for its \u201caggression\u201d and demanding a withdrawal from Ukraine, and 17 African nations abstained \u2013 almost half all abstentions \u2013 and one voted against. A majority of African countries backed the resolution which was passed by 141 to 5.\n\nIn several important strategic states, Moscow has made a significant impact, reinforcing anti-western narratives, supporting friendly political leaders and extracting valuable resources that have helped Russia resist the western sanctions imposed following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lavrov (second left) and the Arab League secretary general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit (left), greet members of the league in Cairo on Sunday. Photograph: AP\n\nOne high-profile actor has been the Wagner Group \u2013 a private company linked to the Kremlin thathas supplied mercenaries to about half a dozen African governments. These have not always met with unmitigated success. A deployment to combat Islamic extremist insurgents in Mozambique was a fiasco. Nor did Wagner fighters in Libya distinguish themselves on the battlefield when supporting the Benghazi-based warlord Khalifa Haftar\u2019s offensive against Tripoli in 2019.\n\nBut when Wagner Group fighters were deployed to Mali following a takeover by military officers last year, they scored a geopolitical success for Moscow. The new regime in Bamako has since forced a major French force fighting jihadist insurgents to leave, pivoting a key state in an important strategic region away from the west. A bomb close to the capital last week underlined how the Wagner fighters have made less progress militarily, however, and have been blamed for multiple human rights abuses.\n\nIn Sudan, where a military coup last year derailed a fragile transition to democratic rule, Russian companies linked to the Wagner Group by western analysts and officials have run goldmines since before the fall of the dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019.\n\nThe military regime in Khartoum also has a close relationship with Moscow and western officials have monitored an intensification in recent months of flights believed to be transporting precious metals to Russia from Sudan. Sudan has also concluded a big deal offering Russia a port on Africa\u2019s eastern coast for 25 years.\n\nAnother key location is Central Africa Republic, where more than 1,000 Wagner mercenaries have mounted a series of bloody offensives against rebels on behalf of a weak central government in return for mining concessions. In recent months, according to witnesses, Russian military contractors have mounted violent and sometimes lethal raids on goldmines in the east of the country apparently aimed solely at looting quantities of gold.\n\nSupport from many African leaders and governments for Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 or at least reluctance to condemn it \u2013 has dismayed western officials.\n\nA once close relationship between the US and UK and Uganda, the next stop on Lavrov\u2019s tour, has soured over the crushing of political dissent and western pressure to recognise LGBT rights. Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986 and the recipient of huge sums of western aid, has accused the west of interfering in domestic affairs. Museveni\u2019s influential son and aspirant successor, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has said on Twitter that \u201cthe majority of mankind (that are non-white) support Russia\u2019s stand in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nEthiopia, where Lavrov will travel after Kampala, might be a tougher sell for Lavrov, though the prime minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s relations with the west have also suffered in recent years following the war in the northern province of Tigray. In Addis Ababa the conversation is likely to be more about money and technology than military assistance.\n\nA major Russia-Africa summit was held in Sochi in 2019. The event is set to be repeated later this year, possibly in the Ethiopian capital.\n\nRussian ties across the continent have been strengthened through investment in mining, financial loans and the sale of agricultural equipment or nuclear technology. Rosatom, the Russian state corporation involved with military and civil use of nuclear energy, has sought to expand in Africa in recent years. Russia was the largest arms exporter to sub-Saharan Africa in 2016-20, supplying almost a third of total sub-Saharan arms imports, up from a quarter in 2011-15, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nOne explanation for the support for Moscow is that many countries across the continent are still ruled by parties that were helped by the USSR during their struggles for liberation from colonial or white supremacist rule. Though few among their youthful populations experienced the bitter battles of the 1960s, 70s or 80s, leaders of ruling parties in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique remember how Soviet weapons, cash and advisers helped them win freedom.\n\nMoscow has sought to highlight this history since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, repeatedly saying that Russia has \u201cnever colonised\u201d any African country and is on the side of Africans against western neoimperialists.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BST\n\nMoscow has also pushed its agenda through covert social media networks , an effort major platforms have struggled to counter.\n\nThe Russian push for influence, coupled with the food crisis, is a dilemma for some African leaders. Egypt, one of the world\u2019s top wheat importers, bought 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine last year and has been torn between ties to Moscow and its close relationship to the west.\n\nWestern officials say Moscow\u2019s strategy is a gamble because the leaders and regimes that its outreach efforts have targeted are often corrupt, repressive and deeply unpopular.\n\nOne study found the 27 African countries that voted for the UN resolution condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine were mostly democracies and all western allies, often actively involved in joint military operations. Most of those that abstained or, like Eritrea, voted against the resolution, were authoritarian or hybrid regimes.",

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\nRussian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, have made statements indicating that Moscow is prioritizing a return to the \u201cOld World Order\u201d \u2013 a mixture of imperial and Soviet-era level of regional influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Iranian leadership has rooted for the Russian invasion of Ukraine defies every principle of the Islamic Republic foreign policy, including its longstanding tenet of resisting imperialism,\u201d says Kourosh Ziabari, the Iran correspondent of Asia Times and 2022 World Press Institute Fellow.\n\nRussia is clearly engaged in \u201cimperial aggression\u201d by \u201cbutchering civilians\u201d in Ukraine; the Islamic Republic, however, has chosen \u201cexpediency and short-term interests which have persuaded the authorities in Tehran to sanitize the war on Ukraine as \u2018preventive\u2019 and \u2018triggered by NATO\u2019s provocations,\u2019 so that Iran is on the \u2018right side\u2019 of Russia\u2019s heart, whose economic, military, and security assistance is direly needed by Tehran these days,\u201d argues Ziabari.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nThe two nations are mirroring each others\u2019 expansionist ambitions: Putin has signaled that he is looking beyond the Soviet Union\u2019s \u201csatellites,\u201d and as far west as Sweden and Poland. Iran, relying on Khomeinist religious dogma, including the exportation of the Islamic Revolution and an ethnocentric nationalism, uses a vast network of proxies, coupled with intelligence and terrorism, to reach deeper into many countries around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fruits of Moscow\u2019s strategy can be found in the partial invasions of various territories, including the partial invasion of Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2014. Tehran is continuing its strong engagement with armed conflicts across the Arab world and in Africa. However, it is not \u201cshared values,\u201d rather common objectives that bind the nations\u2019 interests.\n\nIn fact, the shared values between Iran and Russia are scant, says Ziabari, explaining that historical reasons such as Russia seeking \u201ccolonial concessions from Iran in the 19th century\u201d have left a bad taste in the Iranian collective memory. Many Iranians recall these times and \u201cbelieve Russia has never been a reliable interlocutor,\u201d says Ziabari.\n\nExperts partially attribute the strengthening of the countries\u2019 bilateral relationship as having origins in Russia\u2019s role as an indirect negotiator, on behalf of the United States, in the famed \u201cIran Deal\u201d of Pres. Obama, who had sought to coerce Iran to give-up its nuclear program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPres. Obama\u2019s decision, early in his presidency, to seek a \u2018reset\u2019 with the Kremlin, among other things, was about soliciting Russian diplomatic support to help America get out of the Middle East and \u2018pivot to Asia,\u2019 says Andrew Fink, PhD, an American foreign relations expert.\n\nObama\u2019s thinking was that this would play out in the US\u2019 long term interests as he could say that \u201cThere was a new supply line to Afghanistan, help with a Syrian chemical weapons deal, and a tacit agreement not to sell Russian S-300 air defense systems to Iran. These days, Russia is no longer pretending to be America\u2019s friend in the Middle East,\u201d noted Fink.\n\nAmerican Energy Policies have Pushed Moscow to Strengthen Ties to Tehran\n\nAfter winning the White House, Pres. Biden had promised to restore the \u201cIran Nuclear Deal\u201d which had been gutted by his predecessor, Donald Trump. However, this goal has turned out to be hard to achieve.\n\n\u201cEspecially with hydrocarbon prices spiking, Biden has less leverage over Iran than Obama believed he had,\u201d says Fink, observing that, \u201con the other hand, we no longer labor under the illusion that Russia can help us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers had also sounded alarms that Biden\u2019s attempt to restart the \u201cIran Nuclear Deal\u201d would be detrimental to America\u2019s objectives. Senator Ted Cruz, a critic of Biden\u2019s said that Russia would be the ultimate beneficiary of a new \u201cIran Nuclear Deal\u201d and that the US should instead act urgently to stop Nord Stream 2 in order \u201cto stop an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu, an expert in Iranian security and Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, DC think tank, agrees that if \u201cthe Biden administration\u2019s nuclear diplomacy with Iran yield fruit, it would pave the pathway for greater Russian involvement in Iran\u2019s nuclear space, which in turn will provide Russia with revenue at a critical time.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports in Newsmax, The Guardian, as well as other European publications, Putin\u2019s Kremlin actively pursued a policy of seeking to push the US to take positions that would benefit Russia\u2019s interests, including supporting the removal of sanctions on Nordstream 2, closing gas pipelines in the US, and by infiltrating \u201cgreen\u201d movements \u2013 including with the use of former East German Stasi.\n\nBehnam sees that Russia and Iran will \u201ccontinue to find ways to deepen their relationship, even as Russia is taking up more Iranian market share with oil exports to China. Nonetheless, both have more in common such as a visceral anti-Americanism, distrust and distaste for liberal and representative government, and a desire to be the military hegemon of their region. Together, Russia and Iran see their competition with America as zero-sum and are slated to rely on each other for the medium-term.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the differences between the two countries on various fronts, the Ukraine invasion brought these nations\u2019 mutual interests to the forefront and led to greater cooperation.\n\nIran looks to Russia for future political backing\n\nIran-watchers had predicted the sale of Iranian-made drones to Russia during the Tehran meetings last week. However, Iranian networks, a harbinger of the current arms deals between the two countries, started to provide more advanced weapons, such as RPGs and anti-tank missiles, to Moscow months ago.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic understands its relationship to Putin\u2019s Russia and has long played the role of junior partner. But the potential sale, supply, or transfer of Iranian drones to Russia stands to change this trend,\u201d says Behnam.\n\nThis past April, Russia attempted to use mercenaries recruited from Iran\u2019s proxies in Iraq and Syria to fight in Ukraine. During the same time, Iran was assisting Russia with smuggling weapons to Iraq. Russia and Iran, together, are strongly abacking the Assad Regime in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine is a \u201charsh and difficult issue,\u201d said Khamenei during the press op for his meeting with Putin last week. However, he enunciated, \u201cin the case of Ukraine, if you had not taken the initiative, the other side would have caused the war with its own initiative.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader, ingratiating himself to Putin\u2019s ears, remarked that \u201cif the road is open to Nato, it knows no boundaries and if it was not stopped in Ukraine, they would start the same war some time later under the pretext of Crimea.\u201d\n\nIran must \u201crely on the patronage of any superpower as a security anchor,\u201d explains Ziabari. \u201cPresently, Iran has no chance of rebuilding its adversarial relations with the United States, so being in league with the Western superpower is essentially out of question.\u201d\n\nThere is another angle where the two have a lot in common, says Behnam, which is Iran\u2019s notoriety as experts in sanction bustings, something that \u201cRussia is looking to tap into given the economic sanctions it is facing due to its invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nElaborating further, Behnam continued that \u201cRussia and Iran both are subject to American sanctions for a panoply of reasons and have therefore sought creative ways to get around this powerful financial tool while attempting to signal that they are not as diplomatically isolated as the West may wish.\u201d\n\nThe former Director of an intelligence service in Latin America, who declined to have his name used, indicated that his country had found evidence that during the past few years, Iran had been known to assist in washing money for Venezuela, drug cartels, and Hezbollah: All of whom are part of an emerging global black market of actors who are sanctioned and frozen out of international trade, and thus must find a new means to trade in money and weapons.\n\nWestern Asia\n\nThe risks of closser Russian-Iranian relations are many, say experts. In the context of Ukraine, Tehran\u2019s desire to supply Moscow with more weapons, thus undercutting US and EU sanctions against Russia, is a serious threat.\n\nIranian hackers could be enlisted to team-up with Russia\u2019s large, government-endorsed, hacker networks to create mayhem in Ukraine. This would allow without Iran ever \u201cgetting its hands dirty\u201d through overt military involvement in the conflict.\n\nMore destabilizing for the current world order is that the duo, plus China, could undercut the dollar based financial system and begin to use another currency \u2013 or digital currency \u2013 which would take the West out of their financial loop. For a country, like Ukraine, which is on financial thin ice, a destabilization of the dollar would create grave financial concerns for the Ukrainian Hryvnia.\n\nThe White House\u2019s opposition to return to oil and gas production and exports policies can help keep prices high \u2013 something that suits both Iran and Russia. Likewise, due to internal pressures, it remains probable that a new \u201cIran Nuclear Deal\u201d will not be obtained, however the US will continue attempting to curry favor with Tehran to make one succeed.\n\nExperts say that the rise of a Russian-Iran energy monopoly may soon become a reality, something that would give the autocratic regimes greater leverage in future negotiations. In the lead up to Russia\u2019s full invasion of Ukraine, many American energy experts noted that eastern Ukraine had large potential for energy exploitation \u2013 something that Putin wished to have under his control so that his corner on the gas and oil market was not challenged.\n\nDespite the worrying developments, few offered reasons for optimism about how the West could now confront the new Russian-Iranian threat.\n\nGarry Kasparov, a world champion chess player and a leader of the Russian opposition said, \u201cThere have been many warnings, but when it comes to standing up to dictatorships like Iran and Russia,\u201d this experience teaches us a central lesson: \u201cBorders cannot protect us if our free world hosts won\u2019t take action.\u201d\n\nFor Ukraine, it seems, there is little reason to expect good things to come of the revived Russian-Iranian partnership.",

        "content": "Latvia is calling on Australia to support designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism amid concern about ongoing war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nThe Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, met with the Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, on Monday, outlining his concerns about Russia\u2019s aggression while urging the west to boost military support.\n\nRink\u0113vi\u010ds, who is in Australia to open Latvia\u2019s first embassy in Canberra, said he believed the sanction was necessary given the ongoing atrocities committed in Ukraine. He said he would be calling on the European Union to also support the designation.\n\nThe proposal would result in a complete ban on visas for Russian citizens and the confiscation of Russian government assets, and would also make it easier to put in place a process for war crime proceedings against officials who were directly responsible for committing atrocities in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe have an international criminal court, we have the international court of justice, but the crime of aggression actually does not fall under the responsibility of those courts. So we need to address those things, we need to address the war crimes and genocide that is being committed by Russians against Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nRink\u0113vi\u010ds said he had raised Latvia\u2019s position in his meeting with Wong, and would continue to make the case, which is also being pushed by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nWong said the meeting had emphasised the Australian government\u2019s commitment to holding Russia to account for \u201cits illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine\u201d.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to students at the Australian National University last week, Zelenskiy said the world had to \u201cmake its choice\u201d to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a terrorist and Russia is that terrorists hold themselves accountable for their actions and Russia cannot do even that and tries to accuse other people for their atrocities,\u201d he said.\n\nZelenskiy decried \u201chundreds, thousands of military crimes\u201d and Russian atrocities in the illegal invasion of Ukraine. These included \u201cmass execution of a peaceful population, handcuffing people, put them on their knees, kill them with a shot on their back; and [raping] them in front of the eyes of their own children\u201d.\n\nRink\u0113vi\u010ds said while the US had a legal framework for recognising state-sponsored terrorism, the European Union did not, and he believed this was necessary.\n\nThe Australian government can list an organisation as a terrorist organisation if it is satisfied it is engaged in preparing, planning, assisting or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, however it is unclear how this relates to other governments.\n\nRink\u0113vi\u010ds said he and Wong had agreed on the \u201cnecessity to continue to support Ukraine in any way we can\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe western world must increase military assistance because, as we see unfortunately, Russia is continuing its aggression.\u201d",

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday drew firm distinctions between the United States and Russia as he sought to make the case that the US is the better partner for countries in Africa.\n\nIn a speech about the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cstrategy for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d delivered in Pretoria, South Africa, the top US diplomat argued that \u201cthe United States and African nations can\u2019t achieve any of our shared priorities \u2013 whether that\u2019s recovering from the pandemic, creating broad-based economic opportunities, addressing the climate crisis, expanding energy access, revitalizing democracies, or strengthening the free and open international order \u2013 we can\u2019t do any of that if we don\u2019t work together as equal partners.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur strategy is rooted in the recognition that Sub-Saharan Africa is a major geopolitical force \u2013 one that shaped our past, is shaping our present, and will shape our future,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nBlinken\u2019s visit to the continent \u2013 with stops in South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Rwanda \u2013 and pitch for US partnership there comes as Moscow has sought to step up its influence in Africa amid isolation from Europe over its war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov traveled to Ethiopia, Uganda, the Republic of Congo, and Egypt at the end of July.\n\nBlinken said his visit was not about countering Russia\u2019s influence on the continent, telling South Africa\u2019s \u201ceNCA\u201d that the US\u2019 \u201cfocus is not on saying to friends, partners: you have to choose.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus is on providing a choice,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, his speech included a number of examples calling out Moscow for its negative influence on the continent, specifically as it relates to the war in Ukraine, and the accompanying 17-page strategy document released by the White House makes explicit reference to Russia\u2019s role there.\n\n\u201cRussia views the region as a permissive environment for parastatals and private military companies, often fomenting instability for strategic and financial benefit. Russia uses its security and economic ties, as well as disinformation, to undercut Africans\u2019 principled opposition to Russia\u2019s further invasion of Ukraine and related human rights abuses,\u201d that document says.\n\nIn his speech Monday, Blinken made reference to the Wagner Group, a mercenary group backed by Moscow, and its negative impact in nations throughout Africa.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that strong democracies tend to be more stable and less prone to conflict, but that poor governance, exclusion, and corruption inherent in weak democracies makes them more vulnerable to extremist movements as well as to foreign interference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat includes the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, which exploits instability to pillage resources and commit abuses with impunity, as we\u2019ve seen in Mali and the Central African Republic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States recognizes African countries face real security concerns, and that countless communities are afflicted by immense scourges of terrorism and violence,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the answer to these problems is not Wagner. It\u2019s not any other mercenary group.\u201d\n\nHe also sought to emphasize the global impact on food insecurity of Russia\u2019s war \u2013 a point repeatedly made by the Biden administration as it tries to counter Russian propaganda claiming Kyiv and the West are to blame.\n\nLast week, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield delivered a speech in Ghana outlining in detail Moscow\u2019s culpability for adding to the food crisis. For months, tons of Ukrainian grain was unable to reach international markets due a Russian blockade of major ports on the Black Sea. Only in recent weeks have ships been able begun to safely transit through the waterway. However, officials have said unblocking the ports alone is not sufficient to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing war.\n\n\u201cEven before President Putin launched his full invasion, 193 million people around the world were in need of humanitarian food assistance. The World Bank believes Russia\u2019s invasion could add another 40 million people to this unprecedented number. Most are in Africa,\u201d Blinken said.\n\n\u201cThe United States is there for African countries in this unprecedented crisis, because that\u2019s what partners do for each other,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Pentagon announced Monday that the US has sent anti-radar missiles for Ukrainian aircraft to target Russian radar systems, marking the first time the Defense Department has acknowledged sending the previously undisclosed missile to Ukraine.\n\nColin Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy, said at a press briefing that the US had sent \u201ca number\u201d of the missiles without specifying how many the US has provided or when they were sent. Kahl did not explicitly say what type of anti-radiation missile was sent.\n\nA defense official told CNN the type of missile sent was the AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM).\n\nProduced by Raytheon, HARMs have a range in excess of 30 miles, according to the US Air Force, making them one of the longer-range weapons the US has provided to Ukraine. The missiles can be used to target Russian anti-aircraft radar systems, such as the S-400, which have made it very difficult for the Ukrainian Air Force to operate over large swaths of Ukrainian airspace. The missiles can also target Russian counter-battery radars, which Russia uses to target Ukrainian artillery.\n\nKahl said the missiles had been sent over \u201cin recent [Presidential Drawdown Authority] packages,\u201d but the five most recent packages, dating to July 1, make no mention of HARMs.\n\n\u201cIn the near term, we\u2019ve been doing lots of things to make Ukraine\u2019s existing air force stay in the air and be more capable,\u201d Kahl said.\n\nHe pointed to the spare parts for Mig-29s that the US helped send into Ukraine to keep the Soviet-era fighter jets flying. Kahl then mentioned the missiles, saying they \u201ccan have effects on Russian radars and other things.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians have not publicly acknowledged receiving or using HARMs.\n\nIn recent days, open source reports have shown the remains of what appear to be the fin of a HARM missile that targeted a Russian position in Ukraine.\n\nKahl announced the missiles in a briefing about the Pentagon\u2019s latest $1 billion weapons package for Ukraine, the largest package of US weapons to date.\n\nThe package was focused on supplying ammunition for some of the key weapon systems the US has sent to Ukraine. That includes the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which the Ukrainian military has effectively used to target Russian command posts, ammo depots, and more, as well as the M777 howitzers that have been a critical part of the fight in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia, Kahl said, has had approximately 70,000-80,000 casualties of war, including killed and wounded in action, so far in the conflict.\n\n\u201cThat number might be a little lower, little higher, but I think that\u2019s kind of in the ballpark,\u201d he said. He also added that Russia has lost between 3,000-4,000 armored vehicles.\n\nWith this latest package, the US has committed to sending Ukraine a total of $9.1 billion in security assistance since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion in late February.",

Landmines are also a risk.\n\nWhile it might seem like a ghoulish way to spend a vacation, Visit Ukraine\u2019s founder and CEO Anton Taranenko tells CNN Travel it\u2019s not the same as \u201cdark tourism\u201d that sees visitors flock to other sites of death, disaster and destruction around the world.\n\nTaranenko says the tours represent a chance for Ukraine to highlight its citizens\u2019 spirit of defiance as well as showing the outside world that life goes on, even in a war.\n\n\u2018Living life no matter what\u2019\n\nVisit Ukraine.Today is encouraging foreign travelers to make a trip to Ukraine.

Life goes on and there\u2019s hope that soon all this will be over.\n\n\u201cChildren are growing up, we try to live life as much as possible no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe US Department of State currently has a \u201cLevel 4: Do Not Travel\u201d warning against Ukraine because of the Russian invasion. It urges all US citizens to leave the country immediately and warns that, following the suspension of operations at its Kyiv Embassy, no consular assistance can be offered.\n\nSimilar alerts have been issued by other countries. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth and Development Office warns there is a \u201creal risk to life\u201d due to attacks on cities and regions.\n\nNevertheless, Taranenko is urging people to visit. \u201cIf you want to see our destroyed cities and brave people fighting, please come now,\u201d he says.\n\nBut, he adds, visitors must be aware that nowhere in Ukraine is 100% safe, although having a guide will help mitigate the danger.\n\n\u201cWe regularly check the situation so we can monitor the different levels of safety,\u201d he says, pointing out that many Ukrainians have now returned to areas they initially fled, particularly the capital Kyiv, due to the invasion.\n\n\u201cUkraine is rising again, people are coming back to cities, municipalities are starting to rebuild, cities are recovering from the horrors and there are one million foreigners in the country. Kyiv is now the most visitable and safest place,\u201d says Taranenko.\n\nDiscovering the country, he adds, means looking into the eyes of Ukrainians whose lives have changed forever but who live in anticipation of victory.\n\nVisit Ukraine has been appreciated by the government for its work in supporting the war-hit country\u2019s decimated tourism industry and supplying information to help citizens arriving and leaving. But there\u2019s no official approval for its current drive to encourage visitors.\n\n\u201cNow is not the appropriate time to visit, but after we win and the war is over, we will invite people to visit Ukraine,\u201d Mariana Oleskiv, chairperson at the State Agency for Tourism Development of Ukraine, told CNN.\n\n\u201cAt state-level we want Ukraine to be open to tourism but for that we need more weapons, we need to win and stop the war. Our official position is visit Ukraine when it will be safe to visit, maybe possible to do it next year, I hope.\u201d\n\nOleskiv said that domestic tourism had actually restarted within Ukraine, reaching up to 50% of pre-war levels despite the fighting, but it was too early and too risky for foreigners to come. She suggested tours could be bought as a way to support the tourism industry.\n\n\u2018Like rolling a dice\u2019\n\nForeign governments have warned their citizens against visiting. Visit Ukraine\n\nAlthough martial law has been introduced in Ukraine and air traffic has been suspended, Taranenko says foreign visitors can still quite easily travel in and out by land, passing through the country\u2019s eastern checkpoints with Europe.\n\nWhile travel is possible, independent travel security experts warn against it.\n\nCharlie McGrath, owner of Objective Travel Safety, a UK-based company that trains people for war zones, says even areas of Ukraine that appear to be safe can pose a real risk.\n\n\u201cI invite extreme caution due to the ongoing random Russian attacks,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cEven though far west Ukraine is relatively safe and life appears to go on, the southeast is much more dangerous. It would be like rolling a dice.\u201d\n\nHe says visitors would need reassurances over what protection they\u2019ll be offered on the tours and what happens if they get injured or their guide gets killed. There are also questions about what hospitals and local resources would be involved.\n\n\u201cI would recommend not to do it,\u201d he adds.\n\nTaranenko says, regardless of the risks, there is an appetite for visiting Ukraine. Of the 150 tickets sold so far, 15 have been to Americans, he says.\n\nTour groups will be limited to groups of 10. Participants will meet their guide at the pickup points and be prepped on how to act should a critical situation arise \u2013 such as where to find shelter if air raid sirens sound.\n\n\u201cHaving a guide who knows the place and exactly which direction to take is a guarantee,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you venture on your own 10 meters on the left, or 10 meters on the right, you might end up on a mine or bomb.\n\n\u201cFor instance in the Bucha area there are forests with bombs still activated that could explode anytime.\u201d\n\n\u2018Normal life\u2019\n\nUkrainian officials also urge visitors to stay away until the war is over. Visit Ukraine\n\nThe day tours are 3-4 hours long but can be expanded, based on requests. The company says profits from the sale of all tickets goes to support war refugees.\n\nOleksii Vlasenko, 32, a Kyiv-based business travel entrepreneur told CNN he attended one of the tours in July, visiting several conflict-damaged cities. He said while he did not face any apparent hazards during the trip, there was an inherent danger.\n\n\u201cOf course there is always a risk, as the war continues, but I think it\u2019s different now,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are interested in traveling to see the destruction after the war. However, I would not recommend the tour to women and children, but to young men, why not?\n\n\u201cIn Kyiv, Lviv, Bucha, Irpin, there\u2019s a normal life now back, despite rocket alarms every day, there are no Russian occupant soldiers anymore.\u201d\n\nAmong the tours on offer is a collection titled \u201cBrave Cities,\u201d which take in destinations like \u201cstrong and invincible Bucha and Irpin\u201d \u2013 two locations close to Kyiv which were brutally targeted by Russia in the early days of the invasion.\n\nHighlights read like a retrospective of some of the worst headlines of the conflict, with trips to bombed-out residential areas and damaged cultural treasures.\n\nOther city tours include \u201cPersistent and hardy Sumy,\u201d \u201cKyiv In One Day,\u201d \u201cSightseeing Tour of Lviv\u201d and \u201cOdesa - a Pearl by the Sea.\u201d\n\nSome areas like Mariupol and Mykolaiv, either under Russian control or still under sustained attack from Russian forces, remain off-limits to tours.\n\nBut Taraneko is optimistic he\u2019ll be inviting visitors there next year when, he says, the war will hopefully have ended.",

Effective and highly capable Ukrainian intelligence was created virtually from scratch in 2014.\n\nSince the Soviet Union and up to 2014, many Russian agents worked in the Ukrainian special services. Former President Viktor Yanukovych introduced Russian agents to the leadership of the Special Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukrainian intelligence service (GUR) from the time of his administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, when Russian first invaded eastern Ukraine, the SBU and GUR were rendered ineffective. Currently, a large-scale purge is being carried out in the SBU and traitors are regularly arrested.\n\nUnder Yanukovych\u2019s leadership, agents of the Russian Federation were appointed to the Ministry of Defense and deliberately sabotaged the GUR. As a result, the GUR did not have sufficient data on the Russian army, its movements and concentrations of its forces on the border. GUR management had to restore its structure at a frantic pace to tackle the Russian offensive in 2014.\n\nThe heroic defense of Donetsk airport began precisely with the operation of the Ukrainian intelligence detachment of Colonel Maksym Shapoval, which freed the airport from the Russian occupiers.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nShapoval\u2019s unit collected evidence of Russia\u2019s aggression, data on the deployment of Russian artillery and conducted operations in the deep rear of the enemy. It distinguished itself in the battles for the strategic height of Savur-Mohyla, located about five kilometers from the border between Ukraine and Russia\u2019s Rostov Oblast.\n\nSpecial operation in Crimea\n\nIn 2016, on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to illegally occupied Crimea, the leadership of Ukraine decided to show the occupying forces that their presence would not be safe, hence they planned a special operation in Crimea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn August 6-8, 2016, a sabotage group consisting of five fighters of the GUR under the command of the current chief of the GUR, Kyrylo Budanov, launched a raid on Crimea.\n\nIts purpose was to sabotage the Russian air base.\n\nUkrainian fighters landed from the sea on the western coast of Crimea, took the necessary weapons, then boarded a rented minibus to drive closer to the target of their attack.\n\nThe Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) received information about the activities of the Ukrainian special services in Crimea and all FSB forces were alerted.\n\nA group of those forces surrounded a car with Ukrainian fighters in Crimea, led by Lieutenant Colonel Roman Kamenev, a direct subordinate to the head of the Crimean FSB, Viktor Palagin. Kamenev was shot dead by Ukrainian fighters as a result of a skirmish.\n\nBudanov\u2019s group of fighters managed to escape since the Russians failed to find Ukrainian saboteurs. In some incredible way, they managed to secretly leave Crimea and outwit all the Russian special services and the military. In essence, the entire Russian armada could not detect a whole five saboteurs in a tiny area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the night of August 7-8, according to information from a Russian court, Ukrainian saboteurs broke through the blockade in the area controlled by units of the 247th Airborne Assault Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces. Russian corporal Semyon Sychev was killed in an overnight skirmish.\n\nAs a result of these operations, Budanov is now high on the list of targets for Russian mercenaries. Just days ago, the SBU neutralized a contract killing attempt on Budanov and Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.\n\nNotwithstanding these events, the successful operations of our military intelligence remain unknown to the general public. Budanov has stated that he believes August will be a turning point in Russia\u2019s full-scale war of attrition against Ukraine.",

Today we can state that the war has entered a hot phase,\" Viktor Khrenin said.\n\n\"It is our deep conviction that the special military operation that Russia had to launch on the territory of Ukraine is not another local military conflict. This is an external manifestation of the global civilizational confrontation between the West and the East. We are in absolute solidarity with our Russian colleagues on this. They have outlined their vision of what is happening in recent publications on the mental war against Russia,\" the defense minister said.\n\n\"We make the one and only conclusion: the fight is life-and-death on all fronts. If the concept of globalism prevails, the West will retain the right to dictate the rules of the game to the rest and freely dispose of the world's resources for the prosperity of the \u2018golden billion'. Because in the future multipolar world the countries of Western civilization will have to part with the hegemony status and waive the control over the resource base with all the ensuing consequences for their well-being. Therefore, the reason they fighting a modern version of the proxy war in Ukraine by the hands of Ukrainians is to retain their lifestyle,\" Viktor Khrenin emphasized.\n\nIn his opinion, in this war by proxy Ukraine is a pawn in the big game. \"Washington and London are spearheading the confrontation against the so-called Russian world, but being not ready for a direct confrontation, they prefer to throw their vassals into the meat grinder of war, placing themselves above the battle,\" he said. \u201cThe European allies of the United States and the UK, at their instigation, continue to pump Ukraine with weapons and ammunition. The governments of Eastern European countries, despite the things that have happened to Ukraine, continue to follow its suit and openly sell Russophobia and their citizens.\u201d\n\nThe Moscow security forum has brought together more than 700 guests, including defense ministers, chiefs of general staff, delegations of the military departments, representatives of the expert community from different states, as well as representatives of international organizations. The conference focuses on global and regional stability, and various aspects of security in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.",

The symbol, memorializing missing loved ones, has taken on a new meaning and represents defiance against Russia\u2019s upcoming phoney referendum votes in Kherson and other occupied regions to approve annexation by Russia. Kherson\u2019s vote is scheduled for 9/11 \u2014 the anniversary of America\u2019s worst terrorist attack \u2014 and only half of its 280,000 residents remain there after it was occupied in March. Russians offer $165 to vote in favor of annexation and may end up forcing most of them to do so. People are being jailed or shot there for protesting, speaking Ukrainian, or refusing to use the Russian Ruble and yet resistance builds. Now Russian soldiers stay off its streets following assassinations and last week its Russian-backed Mayor was poisoned by his chef. Now in the run-up to the vote, a military battle has begun to recapture the region and a great deal rests on its outcome.\n\nPutin plans to stage referenda in four regions \u2014 Kherson, Zaporizhzhia (sic), Luhansk, and Donetsk \u2014 in the midst of war. Russian advances in the east have been stalled by Ukrainian forces and a counter-attack by Kyiv in the south is underway. The fighting over Zaporizhzhia has garnered the most headlines because its nuclear plant, Europe\u2019s largest, is controlled by 500 Russian soldiers. Shelling around it has sparked global alarm because attacks may result in damage to its six reactors. The United Nations has demanded that experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency occupy the facility and that the region around it be declared a Demilitarized Zone, but Russia has refused. The plant is Putin\u2019s nuclear blackmail card and his control means he can shut it down for the winter, removing 25 per cent of all power generated in Ukraine. Residents nearby are evacuating.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nObviously, Putin\u2019s referendum voting date of 9/11 is designed to spite Washington, and is being hurried by Moscow to \u201clegitimize\u201d ownership to eliminate these territories as concessions in any negotiations. But Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says if the rigged votes are taken, there will be no negotiations. They have been condemned internationally and Washington described them as \u201cpremeditated, illegal and illegitimate\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM! Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\nThis is Moscow\u2019s \u201chybrid war\u201d playbook: occupy then \u201cRussify\u201d territory by killing and driving out Ukrainian majorities and replacing them with Russian transplants or co-opted captives. This is how he took over Crimea in 2014 \u2014 a maneuver that has been internationally condemned. In 2014, votes were not taken in Luhansk and Donetsk because Russia\u2019s invasion was stopped midway by a ragtag army of Ukrainian militias and ordinary citizens. The lands were frozen and remained in the hands of Russian military and mercenaries, and a low-grade war continued for eight years as the two sides failed to reach a settlement under the Minsk Agreement, mediated unsuccessfully by Germany and France. The day before the February 24, 2022 invasion, Putin declared them Russian territories and used them as a pretext to invade the entire country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyiv\u2019s counter-attack in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia is strategically important because they control water and power to Crimea and form a land bridge to Russia. Still outgunned, Ukraine deploys long-range artillery and \u201cbee sting\u201d assaults by small teams, guerrillas or special forces. With more high-powered Western weapons, and more en route, Ukraine and Western experts believe this counter-attack will work and achieve several objectives: demoralize, divide, and further degrade Russian forces; prevent the occupation of Odessa and Russian control of the Black Sea coast; and further convince Western backers it can beat a more powerful, but rapidly debilitating, Russia.\n\nLast week, long-range missiles struck the heart of Russian military installations in Crimea, where its sole warm-water naval base is located and which is the supply hub for its military campaign in Ukraine\u2019s southern provinces. Its missiles have also destroyed large supply trains, bridges, roads, and miles of rail lines used to carry Russian troops and munitions from Crimea to Kherson. Other assaults have wiped out a war ship, ammunition depots, and most of the airfields and jet fighters in the surrounding region.\n\nThe bombing of Crimea made headlines and crossed two of Putin\u2019s alleged \u201cred lines\u201d \u2013 that targets inside Russia cannot be attacked and, secondly, that Western weapons cannot be used to directly attack Russia under threat of retaliation toward NATO. In response, Ukraine said that its military didn\u2019t execute the attack, the missiles were Ukrainian-made not NATO-sourced and that Crimea is not part of Russia but is part of Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRetired U.S. Admiral James Stavridis believes Ukraine will win the war this year and noted that \u201cif Ukraine can take back Kherson, a major psychological and geographical target, it controls water supply and key routes into Crimea.\u201d Others maintain Ukraine has only a 50-50 to re-occupy Kherson this fall. But President Volodymyr Zelensky boasted after the Crimea bombing last week that the first invasion of Ukraine began in 2014 with the takeover of Crimea and the \u201cwar must end with the liberation of Crimea. It is Ukrainian and we will never give it up.\u201d\n\nA staggering 93 percent of Ukrainians agree and see the future as \u201crather promising\u201d while 98 percent think Ukraine will win the war, according to a new poll. More than half believe that Ukraine will restore its 1991 borders, winning back Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Crimea. Unfortunately, some Europeans, like a group of Italian politicians, are proposing complete capitulation: Ceasefire, a promise of Ukrainian neutrality, Western security guarantees, autonomy for the Donbas (Luhansk and Donetsk) within Ukraine, withdrawal of Russian forces and relaxation of sanctions and the status quo concerning Crimea. This insulting proposal would roll back the clock to 2014 \u2014 creating a frozen conflict despite an unprovoked Russian invasion which will simply lead to yet-another Russian invasion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Ukrainians are not giving up and fortunately their yellow ribbons proliferate in response to Russia\u2019s fake votes, genocide, war crimes, and subjugation. The color of Ukraine\u2019s hardy sunflowers, this is the symbol of Ukraine\u2019s courage and resistance against Russian genocide, war crimes, and subjugation. And the West must give thanks for that.",

        "content": "The International Crimea Platform participants have issued a joint statement following the event.\n\nThat\u2019s according to the Ukrainian President\u2019s Office, Ukrinform reports.\n\n\u201cOne year ago, on 23 August 2021, we gathered in Kyiv to establish the International Crimea Platform, based on the non-recognition of Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, which constitutes a violation of the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine as well as a direct challenge to international security.\n\nWe, the Participants in the International Crimea Platform, remain committed to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters. We reiterate our resolve to maintain pressure on Russia to end the temporary occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol without delay to restore Ukraine\u2019s control over its territory.\n\nWe condemn in the strongest terms Russia\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified invasion and its war of aggression against Ukraine, and notably its use of the temporarily occupied Crimean Peninsula and Ukrainian territorial waters for its war against Ukraine. We strongly condemn Russia\u2019s extensive use of military aircraft and warships for missile strikes and attacks affecting civilians and Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. We also condemn the use of Crimea for aggression against and military invasion of southern Ukrainian regions. All perpetrators of war crimes should be brought to justice.\n\nRecalling the resolution ES-11/1 of the UN General Assembly adopted on March 2, 2022, we call on Russia to ensure an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all its forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.\n\nWe regret that against this backdrop the situation in temporarily occupied Crimea has further deteriorated.\n\nWe are deeply concerned about the increase in repressive measures by Russian occupying authorities, including abuses of human rights of the indigenous Crimean Tatars severely threatening their ability to fully enjoy their human rights, maintain and develop their culture, education and identity.\n\nWe are equally concerned with the aggressive imposition of education in the Russian language, of Russian curricula and education materials and with efforts to use the education system for the propaganda of service in the armed or auxiliary forces of the Russian Federation among children.\n\nWe call on the Russian Federation to comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law, to immediately and unconditionally release Ukrainian prisoners unjustly detained in Crimea and the territory of Russia, including Nariman Dzhelyalov, the First Deputy Head of the Mejlis of Crimean Tatar people, and to comply with the order of the International Court of Justice of April 19, 2017 to refrain from maintaining the ban on the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people and provide full and unimpeded access to Crimea for established regional and international monitoring mechanisms.\n\nWe condemn the continued practice of illegal conscription of Crimean residents into the Russian Armed Forces and their reported forced involvement in Russia\u2019s offensive military actions against Ukraine.\n\nWe also condemn Russia's resettlement of its citizens to the Peninsula seeking to forcibly change the demographic composition of Crimea in a blatant attempt to deepen its occupation and control.\n\nWe are also deeply concerned by numerous reports of forcible transfer by the Russian Federation of Ukrainian citizens, in particular civilians and prisoners of war, including Crimean Tatars, from the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine to Crimea and Russia.\n\nWe equally deplore Russia\u2019s seizure of the Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov and in Kherson, which has impeded the lawful exercise of navigational rights and freedoms and maritime traffic in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, contributing to global food insecurity. We are further concerned about the massive transportation of heavy weapons and personnel through Crimea, which is aggravating the ecological consequences of Russia`s temporary occupation of Crimea since 2014.\n\nWe recognise that the increasing militarization of the Peninsula by the Russian Federation continues to have a negative impact on the security situation in the Black Sea region.\n\nWe condemn Russia\u2019s reported attempts to trade in stolen grain and metallurgy from Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, we condemn Russia\u2019s attempts to forcefully integrate parts of the Ukrainian territory currently under the control of invading Russian armed forces as a result of their illegal invasion. Any attempts to redraw Ukraine\u2019s borders by force are a clear violation of international law, including the UN Charter and of Ukraine\u2019s Constitution, they further undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and will not be recognised.\n\nWe stand firmly with the people of Ukraine as they bravely face Russia\u2019s military aggression and express our solidarity with those in Crimea and other Ukraine\u2019s territories under Russia\u2019s temporary control who continue to speak up at great personal risk against Russia\u2019s temporary occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and Russia`s ongoing military invasion.\n\nIn this context we express our determination to continue our support of Ukraine, including political, economic, humanitarian and/or security assistance.\n\nWe express our determination to continue working together within the International Crimea Platform on ending the Russian Federation\u2019s temporary occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol for the full restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.\n\nWe confirm the need to continue implementing the policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol by the Russian Federation.\n\nWe reiterate our commitment to maintain pressure on Russia to end its temporary occupation of Crimea and to restore Ukraine\u2019s control over the territory of the Peninsula.\n\nThis would create a solid basis for the restoration of the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It would also contribute to improving security and stability in the region and global food security, as well as allowing bringing perpetrators to justice.\n\nWe express our readiness to consider or to join further political diplomatic and restrictive measures towards the Russian Federation should its actions so require and in line with the respective procedures and legal jurisdiction of each Participant.\n\nWe stand by Ukraine as it defends its territorial integrity and sovereignty against the Russian aggression.\n\nWe invite other states and organizations to consider joining the International Crimea Platform.\u201d",

On this day back in 1991, the National Parliament voted for the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine and inherited Ukrainian statehood for Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic (1917-1921) which independence was taken away by the communist dictatorship. We broke away from the Soviet past and proceeded with determining our own destiny,\" the statement said.\n\nIt added that since then, the Ukrainian nation has achieved even more than ever before in its millennia-long history. \"We have asserted ourselves as a country of Freedom and Dignity, as a creative and innovative state of diversity and endless new opportunities. This year we have anchored ourselves on the path to the European Union full-fledged membership by receiving EU candidate status and increasing the pace of European transformations even amid the full-scale military invasion of our territory by the Russian Federation that lasts for the last 6 months,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe ministry said that On February 24, 2022, bravery became Ukraine's contemporary national brand attribute in the struggle against the occupier who came to our land to destroy the Ukrainian state, nation and identity. \"The Ukrainian Armed Forces, other defense forces and the entire nation have set an example of heroism, unity and self-sacrifice in the name of freedom and with the aim to defend our independence,\" the ministry said.\n\n\"We fight against the aggressor state on the land and in the air, on the sea and in the information and cyber domains, that makes the contribution of every single Ukraine citizen so important,\" the ministry said.\n\nIt also added, \"We are grateful to our partners and friends who introduced devastating sanctions against Russia, provided the Ukrainian people with decisive military, humanitarian and financial support and shared their homes with those Ukrainians, whom the war forced temporarily to flee. To overcome the biggest challenge to mankind since World War II, it is vital to keep supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nAccording to diplomats, \"all nations, interested in the restoration of stable peace and rule-based international order, should put their efforts to bring all Russian war criminals and Russia\u2019s political leaders to justice for committing terrifying war crimes that brought suffering to the Ukrainian people and threatened global security.\"\n\nThe ministry called on \"all states and organizations to support the establishment of the Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine.\" \"Together, we should ensure that the Putin regime loses all its influence in the world and its ability to wage brutal wars against sovereign states. Thus, we call on our partners to introduce a full oil and gas embargo, expand sectoral and individual sanctions against Russia, Russian elites and state-owned enterprises, as well as completely cut off Russia from the Western banking system,\" the statement said.\n\nAccording to diplomats, \"the lesson of 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea and waged war in Donbas is clear: any compromise with the Kremlin today will turn into even more brutal aggression tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Setting the defeat of the aggressor as the ultimate goal is the best investment in lasting sustainable global peace under the rule of international law. We believe that with this wide and dedicated international support, Ukraine will celebrate the next Independence Day in peace and within its internationally recognized borders,\" the ministry said.",

Losing Ukraine in this war will really threaten the security of everyone in Europe - she said.\n\nThe British Minister of Foreign Affairs also assured that London would deliver \"all equipment that she would need to displace the Russians\" and urged that every \"partner of Ukraine\" would do the same.- If we do not stop Putin in Ukraine, it will be a threat to others: Baltic countries, Poland, Moldova and this may end in a conflict with NATO - she noted.\n\nThe politician has repeatedly condemned war crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, includingslaughter in Bucza, and also drew attention to the need to investigate and pull the perpetrators responsible.\n\nLiz Truss also announced that if necessary she would be ready to use the Arsenal of Great Britain if she were at the forefront of the government.\n\n\"Poland has always clearly seen Putin's intentions\"\n\nIn April, after meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zbigniew Rau, the head of British diplomacy emphasized that \"Poland has always clearly seen the issue of Russia and Putin's intentions.\"She also thanked Poles for helping Ukrainian refugees.- At this time, the ruined European security we are very, very grateful for what Poland did - she said.\n\n- You were on the first line of help of Ukraine, supporting those who escaped from this terrifying war.You stood unmoved on the side of the Ukrainian nation and at every opportunity you called for sharper actions against Putin - she added.\n\nAt that time, Liz Truss also talked about the need to strengthen the NATO eastern flank.\n\nMore messages on Gazeta.pl's main page\n\nBoris Johnson's resignation in an atmosphere of a scandal\n\nBoris Johnson's government began to fall apart after the media revealed the matter of the moral scandal.It's about the promotion of Chris Pincher.Although there was allegations of sexual harassment on the conservative party member, the prime minister appointed him to the position of deputy Whipa, i.e. the person responsible for discipline at the parliamentary club.The matter was worsened by unreliable and, as everything indicates, false explanations, which the spokesman for the last few days was made.He insisted that Johnson did not know anything.\n\nThe scandal caused an avalanche to leave the Great Britain's government.Within two days, nearly 60 officials and colleagues of the prime minister left him - which is a record result.The first to resign by the Minister of Finance Rishi Sunak and Minister of Health Sajid Javid.British Minister for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis resigned the last to resign.\"It is clear that our party, colleagues in parliament, volunteers and the whole country deserve more\" - wrote a politician in a resignation letter.Honesty, ethics, mutual respect - according to the former minister - the administration of Boris Johnson did not represent these values.\"I defended this government, both privately and in public. However, we are already at a point from which there is no retreat,\" Lewis added.\n\nUltimately, Boris Johnson resigned on July 7.",

On the one hand, countries publicly condemn the aggression but on the other, they are putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn\u2019t close completely,\u201d said Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, who is leading the country\u2019s effort to establish the international tribunal.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are attempting to keep some space for diplomatic manoeuvres,\u201d said Smyrnov. \u201cWe know that agreements with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis claims come as the US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday that Russia should not be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, something Ukrainian officials and some US politicians had pushed for. Russia had previously said such a designation would mean Washington had crossed the point of no return.\n\n\n\nUkrainian officials say that since April, they have been trying to convince their western allies to establish an ad hoc tribunal which would hold Russia\u2019s senior leadership responsible for the crime of aggression for invading Ukraine. Aggression is viewed as the supreme crime under international law because without the transgression of borders during an invasion, subsequent war crimes would not have been committed.\n\nSo far only the Baltic states and Poland have pledged support for the tribunal, said Ukraine\u2019s officials. \u201cWe are expecting broader support,\u201d said Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin. \u201cFor us, the support of the UK and the US is very important as well as the rest of the civilised world,\u201d said Smyrnov.\n\nThe UK\u2019s newly elected prime minister, Liz Truss, told Times Radio in May, when she was foreign secretary, that she would consider supporting the tribunal. The Council of Europe is due to discuss support for such a measure on 13 September.\n\n\n\nAt an event in Brussels on Monday, Andriy Yermak \u2013 chief adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 asked why there was a delay in creating the tribunal and said some European officials seemed convinced the international criminal court (ICC) was enough.\n\n\n\nAt the same event, the European commissioner for justice, Didier Reynders, said he was open to the idea, but talked mainly about help the EU is giving to compile war crimes which can be referred to the ICC.\n\nUkraine favours a one-off international tribunal to try the Russian leadership for aggression, which is not within the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. The court is set to bring cases of war crimes which require prosecutors to identify the direct perpetrators of a crime and then trace the command structure upwards, making it difficult to reach the top echelons of the Russian regime.\n\nWestern allies have, however, been reluctant to move to try Putin and other senior figures, an act that would probably end all relations. Ukraine believes this is an indication that, despite the scale of atrocities and public declarations against Russia, some of its allies envisage possible negotiations with Russia\u2019s current leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be like trying the concentration camp directors and letting Hitler and his team walk free,\u201d said Oleh Gavrysh, part of Smyrnov\u2019s team in the presidential office. During the Nuremberg trials after the second world war, Nazi leaders were tried for the crime of aggression, which was then known as the crime against peace.\n\nUkraine\u2019s officials say the case would not need much investigation and would act as a straightforward mechanism to ensure the Kremlin\u2019s decision makers face responsibility since the fact that the act of aggression took place was overwhelmingly accepted by a vote at the UN general assembly and has been supported by a resolution of the European parliament. It has also been repeatedly admitted by Putin and his circle.\n\nThe legal arm of the Open Society Foundations has drawn up a preliminary indictment of Putin and seven of his closest allies for the crime of aggression. It said it hoped the document can demonstrate the feasibility of such a tribunal.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you help the ICC, you donate to the independent judicial authority and you are not linked somehow to the result,\u201d said Kostin, Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor. \u201cWhen you support [a] tribunal, you act as a state, it\u2019s a political act and not all of them, at the moment, are ready to politically support this.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cRussia is like terra incognita (unexplored territory) for many of them and some of them want to keep some room to, if not be friends again, but to have some relations, which I don\u2019t understand and no Ukrainians will understand.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If China attacks Taiwan, Pine Gap is likely to be heavily involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that Pine Gap is a fundamentally important element in US war fighting and deterrence of conflict.\u201d\n\nPine Gap is a highly secret US-Australian military installation near Alice Springs. It serves as a major hub for US global intelligence interception, and for satellite surveillance operations for military and nuclear missile threats in the region.\n\nRussia is unlikely to be able to subjugate Ukraine in its current invasion, Dibb said, but Ukrainian military is unlikely to succeed in driving out Russian troops entirely. \u201cMost likely there\u2019ll be a negotiated conclusion, probably at the ceasefire talk.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Dibb argued, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was unlikely to be deposed as a result, but he would be a leader grown increasingly isolated, and the threat of nuclear escalation was real.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that Putin is the sort of person who won\u2019t resile from the use of nuclear weapons, particularly if it looks as though he\u2019s losing this war. But he must surely realise that there\u2019s no such thing as the limited use of tactical nuclear weapons in isolation from their escalation to a full-scale strategic nuclear war.\n\n\u201cOnce we enter the slippery slope of even limited nuclear exchanges, the end result will be escalation to mutual annihilation \u2013 something about which both Putin and Xi Jinping may need reminding.\u201d\n\nThe comprehensive defeat of Russia in Ukraine would bring its own dangers, Dibb argued.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I don\u2019t agree with those who are arguing that America is finished.\u201d\n\nHe said Putin was motivated by an irredentist desire to restore former Soviet glory and power.\n\n\u201cHaving studied the Soviet Union and the threat of nuclear war for decades, the depressing thing is nothing much has changed,\u201d Dibb said. \u201cThat has a lot to do with that history and with geography, but the threat remains, and remains very real.\u201d",

Europe is facing a hard winter of high prices and fuel shortages because of the fallout from sanctions against Moscow and President Vladimir Putin's suspension of Russian gas supplies.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive in the south of the country to try to break a stalemate on the battlefield and convince struggling allies it's worth staying the course.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv was designed to underline that message by emphasising the Americans are committed to seeing this through.\n\nHe announced a further $2.8bn (\u00a32.4bn) in military aid during a meeting with the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, after entering the presidential building through a series of dark hallways fortified with sandbags. (He also visited children injured by Russian bombardments and toured a devasted section of nearby Irpin - seeing first-hand the scorched buildings and scattered debris left behind by Russian shelling of the city).\n\nThe assistance package includes long-term investments to bolster the security of Ukraine and its neighbours. It also delivers more weapons, part of a surge of US support for Ukraine's effort to recapture territory taken by the Russians, which Mr Blinken said was \"proving effective\".",

She said \u201cThis is the face of Russian occupation: towns and cities turned into mass graves. Ukraine has used our military aid with skill and determination. Ukraine can win if we keep supporting them.\u201d\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy likened the discovery to what happened in Bucha , on the outskirts of Kyiv, saying in his Thursday night video address: \u201cRussia is leaving death behind it everywhere and must be held responsible. The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information \u2013 clear, verifiable information \u2013 should be available tomorrow.\u201d\n\nProsecutors, police officers and journalists are heading to Izium after authorities there said they had found a mass grave containing more than 440 bodies. Some of the people had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, authorities said. Serhiy Bolvinov, the chief police investigator for Kharkiv province, said forensic investigations would be carried out on every body in the grave, which was reportedly located in woods near the city. While authorities said some had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, investigators have prepared themselves for the worst, after the discoveries of slain civilians bearing signs of torture in Bucha and other previously occupied territories.\n\nRussia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex and debris, and the local Russian-imposed authorities said that at least one person was killed. Ukraine\u2019s military declined to comment on the explosions. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Kyiv\u2019s operation command south, said Kyiv was keen to avoid \u201cinformational chaos\u201d. \u201cHappiness loves silence,\u201d she remarked.\n\nOn the other side of the country, in the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russia prosecutor and his deputy died when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. The Kremlin news agency Itar-Tass said Sergey Gorenko, the prosecutor general for the so-called Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, died at the scene. Zelenskiy\u2019s senior adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was not behind Friday\u2019s mysterious explosion.\n\nThe Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk has blamed Kyiv for \u201cthe double murder\u201d of the deputy head of the military civil administration, and his wife, who headed the city\u2019s territorial election commission for a proposed referendum on whether the region would join the Russian Federation.\n\nIryna Vereshchuk, the minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, has said Ukraine\u2019s government has approved a draft law that will punish people for forcing Russian passports on to Ukrainian citizens.\n\nThe Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Ukraine\u2019s counterattack against Russian troops had been very effective, but warned nations should prepare for the long haul as this did not signal the beginning of the end of the war. He said: \u201cWe need to understand that this is not the beginning of the end of the war, we need to be prepared for the long haul.\u201d\n\nGermany has taken the German subsidiary of the Russian oil giant Rosneft under state control, putting three refineries into a trusteeship ahead of a partial European embargo on Russian oil at the end of the year. The federal network regulator will become the temporary trust manager of Rosneft Germany and its share of refineries in Schwedt, near Berlin, in Karlsruhe and in Vohburg, Bavaria, Germany\u2019s ministry for economic affairs announced on Friday.\n\nThe European Union chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said she wanted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to face the international criminal court over war crimes in Ukraine. \u201cThat Putin must lose this war and must face up to his actions, that is important to me,\u201d she told the TV channel of the German news outlet Bild on Thursday.\n\nPope Francis said it was morally legitimate for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. \u201cThis is a political decision which it can be moral, morally acceptable, if it is done under conditions of morality \u2026 Self-defence is not only licit but also an expression of love for the homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend [something] love it.\u201d\n\nVladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for his \u201cbalanced\u201d approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washington\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d policies, at a meeting that followed the recent setbacks for Moscow on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine has lost nearly 15% of its grain storage capacity in the war, threatening its role as a key food supplier to the world, a report said. The US government-backed Conflict Observatory said Russians had seized 6.24m tonnes of food storage capacity, and another 2.25m tonnes of capacity in Ukrainian hands had been destroyed, Agence France-Presse reported. As a result, farmers were running out of room to store their output for shipment, which could discourage plantings for the next crop, especially winter wheat, the report said.\n\nGermany will supply Ukraine with additional armoured vehicles and rocket launch systems but will not provide the battle tanks that Kyiv has long asked for, says the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht. She said on Thursday that Soviet-made BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles would also \u201cvery quickly\u201d head to Ukraine from Greece.\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog\u2019s 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution demanding Russia end its occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports. Thursday\u2019s resolution was the second on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s board.",

So, if Russia wanted to retaliate, it would have to choose a lot of enemies and a lot of targets just for the words,\" Landsbergis said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\nTHE UNITED NATIONS: IS IT WORTH ALL THE MONEY?\n\nLithuania was one of many countries that spoke out against Russia\u2019s aggression during the global event, including President Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, who both called out Russia for violating the U.N. charter in its attack against Ukraine.\n\nThe threat of a nuclear disaster or use of nuclear force by Russia has loomed over the war in Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying last week that his country would use \"all the means at our disposal\" and the threat to resort to nuclear weapons is \"not a bluff.\"\n\nPUTIN WARNS WEST: THREAT TO RESORT TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS \u2018NOT A BLUFF\u2019\n\nGiven the gravity of the Russian threat, Landsbergis called on NATO to be \"very clear about the possibility of response in case \u2026 nuclear weapons are being used.\"\n\n\"It does not necessarily have to be a nuclear response. But I think that we possess a number of possible responses that would not escalate the conflict further but yet \u2026 give a very clear answer,\" he said.\n\nBut even without the use of nuclear weapons, Russia has the capability to create a nuclear disaster in Eastern Europe.\n\n\"We have to remember that Vladimir Putin already possesses a nuclear power plant in the occupied territory in Ukraine, which can be used as a weapon. So, it also is a worry for \u2026 many neighbors close to Ukraine, for many countries too close to Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nRUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE \u2018GENOCIDAL,\u2019 REQUIRES WAR CRIME TRIBUNAL: ESTONIAN FOREIGN MINISTER\n\nRussian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine earlier this year, and the site remains near the front lines of the conflict, raising safety concerns over the potential for nuclear disaster.\n\nWhile much of the United Nations General Assembly focused on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, climate change remained a significant topic, and Landsbergis said the world could not \"afford to lose sight of either.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is sometimes how crises work. They do come in waves,\" he said, adding that COVID had been a third, simultaneous crisis.\n\nJAMES CARAFANO: BIDEN AT UNITED NATIONS IS JUST ANOTHER CLOWN SHOW\n\nLandsbergis also warned of the \"vast array of coercion instruments\" China is willing to use against countries around the world.\n\nIn 2021, Lithuania became the first state to withdraw from the Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries initiative, led by Beijing. The country also made the decision to allow Taiwan to open a representative office in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. In retaliation, China enacted a series of economic embargoes and sanctions against Lithuania.\n\n\"What happened to Lithuania can happen in any country, Europe, Indo-Pacific, wherever,\" Landsbergis warned. \"And I think we learned this lesson well; not just Lithuania, but everybody else, I think, should take heed of this and be better prepared.\"\n\nLithuania\u2019s actions, Landsbergis said, were not about standing up to China but rather standing up for \"principles.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe same principles, he said, that have resulted in Lithuania standing up for democracy and territorial integrity around the world, including Ukraine and Taiwan.",

I understand the logic of the Russian partners. If we talk about the conflict in Ukraine, about the war in Ukraine, we need to look back into 2021 when Russia sent relevant proposals to NATO, the United States asking them to take Russia's security concerns on board. But Russia did not receive any answer.

        "content": "MINSK, 26 September (BelTA) - Belarusian Minister of Foreign Affairs Vladimir Makei addressed the 77th session of the UN General Assembly in New York on 24 September, BelTA learned.\n\nThe Belarusian minister said that for more than six months, the world has been living in the \"shadow\" of the conflict in Ukraine. It is adversely affecting so many people on the planet. The conflict like the COVID-19 pandemic that preceded it has once again laid bare the downside of global interdependence.\n\n\u201cThis session provides a unique opportunity to take stock of the situation. Let us, in a very honest and unbiased manner, answer two questions. The answers to them \u2013 as well as the ensuing necessary action \u2013 is what all people around the globe expect from us, the UN Member States. The first is what were the root causes of the conflict in Ukraine? The second is what needs to be done to stop the conflict and prevent similar events from recurring in the future?\u201d Vladimir Makei said.\n\nOn the origins of the conflict\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that the conflict in Ukraine stems from a wider geopolitical chaos, whose causes must be sought in the events that took place 30 years ago. History teaches us that epoch-making wars that resulted in unfair and humiliating peace terms contained the seeds of future conflicts. Let us take a look at what kind of peace was established after the end of the last epochal confrontation \u2013 the Cold War?\u201d Vladimir Makei said.\n\nThe minister noted that the so-called \u201cwinners\u201d, apparently influenced by euphoria, did not consider it necessary to draw on examples from the past. According to Vladimir Makei, they could have followed the path of Alexander I, Metternich and Castlereagh. These great peacemakers of the early 19th century effectively integrated their adversary into a new security system, the Concert of Europe, thereby bringing a lasting peace to Europe that would endure for decades to come.\n\n\u201cLikewise, they could have taken inspiration from the pattern of cooperation established during World War II by the \u201cGreat Three Men\u201d \u2013 Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill, who forged arrangements that significantly narrowed chances for great powers to wage wars against each other. Notwithstanding, the Western policymakers of the early 1990s, unfortunately, chose the most inglorious and unpromising option. Namely, it was the path of the 1919-type Versailles diplomats keen on trampling upon their principled opponent,\u201d Vladimir Makei noted.\n\nHe noted that the Cold War ended not even with an official treaty but with some kind of \"gentleman's agreements\" and declarations. As the subsequent events revealed, the so-called \"winning\" side did not respect them. In fact, the arrangements stood as nothing more than a \"Versailles 2.0.\".\n\n\u201cThe West showed itself selfish by offering the post-Soviet states the one and only path, that is of its satellites. In an effort to embed this status the West chose to expand one of its key Cold War-era institutions \u2013 the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. NATO's eastward expansion occurred despite the arrangements achieved with the West, including by the Soviet leaders. Furthermore, the West overlooked the legitimate security interests of both Russia and Belarus.,\u201d Vladimir Makei said.\n\nIn this regard one cannot fail to recall the outstanding American diplomat George Kennan, whose foreign policy prophecies Western policymakers so much admire. \u201cWhy they failed to heed yet just another of Kennan's famous warnings when in 1996 the diplomat had denounced NATO expansion as \u2018a strategic mistake of potentially epic proportions?'\u201d Vladimir Makei asked.\n\n\u201cWith its drive to enlarge NATO, the West has essentially trampled upon the indivisibility of security, the vital principle, which states that one party must not seek to achieve its own security at the expense of other parties. The peacemakers in 1815 and 1945 well grasped that logic, whereas the world leaders in 1919 and 1991 refused to embrace it,\u201d the Belarusian minister noted.\n\nHe said that NATO's involvement in the illegal wars in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and Syria, in addition to the Alliance's attempts to encroach on some historical Eastern Slavic and adjacent lands predetermined for the Versailles 2.0. the fate of the first Versailles.\n\nTherefore, it is the collective West that should fully bear the responsibility for the ongoing bloodshed in Ukraine. It was exactly the West that made this conflict inevitable \u2013 not only through its decision to expand NATO, but also by its refusal to consider the proposals that came from its opponents. After all, such proposals did come,\u201d Vladimir Makei said.\n\nWhat to do and what three truths the West should realize\n\nThe minister recalled a number of cases when the West was offered cooperation and equal dialogue which the West ignored.\n\nIn 2009, Russia invited all interested parties to sign a new European security treaty that would de jure wrap up the Cold War. The West rejected the proposal.\n\nIn 2017, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko came up with the idea to hold a global security dialogue and proposed Minsk as a venue for negotiations. The opponents let this initiative go unnoticed as well.\n\nLast December, the Russian Federation made yet another attempt to reach an agreement with the West on the issue of European security. As before, the West remained deaf to the new Russian proposal\n\n\u201cWhat explains this \u201crejectionist\u201d stance by the West? The key problem stems from the ongoing clash at the global level between the two incompatible visions of the world order \u2013 concentric and polycentric. The West wants to establish a concentric or a unipolar world, ruled from one center and subordinated to the interests of a Western hegemon. Most other countries, in turn, want to create a polycentric or a multipolar world, with no single center of control, in which no one imposes its visions, interests and values on others,\u201d the Belarusian minister said.\n\n\u201cThe West dominated the world for the past five centuries. Hence, it believes that it can go on with this kind of history indefinitely. As for us, we are deeply convinced that the world has changed and that neo-colonialism in any form is no longer an acceptable and viable option. Five centuries ago, when the West was just beginning its global ascent, the world came to witness the Copernican revolution of knowledge. That revolution took place, first and foremost, in the minds of people of that time, who found it difficult to come to terms with the postulate that it was not the Earth, but the Sun, which stood at the center of the solar system. A similar \"Copernican\" paradigm shift must occur today. As was the case half a millennium ago, it must take place in the minds, too. This time around it must occur in the minds of the West's political mainstream,\u201d Vladimir Makei emphasized.\n\nAccording to him, the West must, at last, realize a number of truths. First. International relations do not revolve around a single, namely, the Western center of power. Second. The world's history has no end, because it is not an inexorable movement of all countries towards the so-called \"liberal democracy\". Third. The world is a too complex structure as to reduce all its problems to a confrontation between the so-called \"democracies\" and \"autocracies\".\n\n\u201cWe have not seen that this kind of realization has registered with the West so far. What we have seen instead is the destruction stubbornly pursued by the West, including self-destruction,\u201d the minister noted.\n\nVladimir Makei also spoke about the sanctions from the West, stressing the futility of this approach.\n\n\u201cEconomic sanctions are almost the only tool in the West's foreign policy toolkit today. One cannot fail to get an impression that the very fact the sanctions have been launched serves as an indicator of their effectiveness for Europe and the United States. And, in this sense what we witness is a substitution of concepts. The key objective has not been achieved, whereas the sanctions keep on living a life of their own,\u201d the minister said.\n\nWithout any trace of hesitation, the goal of sanctions has been stated loud and clear \u2013 to achieve a change of power through food riots. \u201cThis calculation has generally turned out to be a failure. Most countries have not joined the effort to implement the sanctions. Many states under sanctions such as Belarus and Russia are to a large extent self-sufficient. Importantly, the sanctions have given us a powerful impetus to develop hidden internal reserves and reinvigorate regional integration. Undoubtedly, we will weather the \u201cstorm\u201d. We will survive in the same manner as the free-loving Cuba has been surviving illegal sanctions for more than six decades!\u201d Vladimir Makei said.\n\nNonetheless, the sanctions led to the two negative implications, which their sponsors could hardly have anticipated. First, they reduced the supply of fertilizers and food from the countries under sanctions. As a result, those who suffer the most are the poorest people in developing countries. \u201cSuffice it to say that prices in these countries have skyrocketed by 300% over the last half a year, while Africa is facing fertilizer shortages to the tune of over 2 million tonnes,\u201d the minister said.\n\nSecondly, which is truly anecdotal, the sanctions, through a boomerang effect, hit the West itself: \u201cAnd, no matter how some may swagger today, ordinary people in Europe will have to freeze in the coming winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is high time for Western countries to resort to common sense and return to dialogue and cooperation! Even in the current situation Belarus stands ready to embrace dialogue and cooperation on equal terms, without any preconditions and pressure!\u201d the minister said.\n\nOn the lack of alternatives to talks and peace initiatives\n\n\u201cBelarus speaks a lot about the conflict in Ukraine and takes every opportunity to do so. We cannot do otherwise. The conflict is happening at our very doorstep. We are extremely saddened to witness how the fraternal Ukrainian people became a victim of the collective West's geopolitical games. We are convinced that the origins of Ukraine's specific problems should be sought in 2004, when the West managed to carry out the first \u2018color revolution' in this country. The second revolution, a decade later, firmly secured the anti-Russia status for Ukraine,\u201d the minister said.\n\nInstigated by the United States and their allies, Ukraine has been exterminating the people of Donbass for eight years for no other reason than that the local people want to speak their native language, Russian.\n\n\u201cBut the West does not need Ukraine, neither as a member of NATO nor as a member of the European Union. The new patrons simply used it in their own \u2018big game' against Russia. Today, Ukraine is paying the price in blood because its politicians bought into this deception and disregarded the historical brotherhood of the three East Slavic peoples \u2014 Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians. But it is never too late to admit and correct mistakes!\u201d Vladimir Makei stressed.\n\nIn his words, for Belarus, which itself went through the genocide of the Belarusian people during the Second World War, with every third its citizen being killed, it is unbearably painful to see the chaos in the neighboring country and the suffering of ordinary Ukrainians.\n\nThe minister recalled that ever since 2014 Belarus has been making every possible effort to bring peace to Ukraine. It was Belarus that became associated with peace in Donbass when the Minsk agreements were adopted in 2014-2015. Right after the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine last February, it was the President of Belarus who managed to get the parties to the conflict sit down at a negotiating table, once again on Belarus' soil. Belarus hosted three successful rounds of Ukrainian-Russian negotiations, which opened up real prospects for bringing the conflict to an end. \u201cUnfortunately, this process has since stalled,\u201d Vladimir Makei said.\n\n\u201cWe remain deeply convinced that both a ceasefire agreement and a comprehensive strategic peace settlement around Ukraine can be achieved only through negotiation. There is no alternative to talks! Otherwise, we will all get a new third Versailles,\u201d the Belarusian minister of foreign affairs said.\n\nAccording to him, as a neighbor and an affected country, Belarus should be part and parcel of a negotiation process and of final security guarantees.\n\n\u201cWe very much hope that the tragic events in Ukraine will compel the collective West to realize rather quicker that changes in international relations are irreversible. The sooner this happens, the sooner peace can be brought to Ukraine and other hot spots, and the sooner we can lay the foundation for a new just world order,\u201d the minister said.\n\nAs a crucial step in this process Belarus views a global security dialogue in the true spirit of San Francisco, whose urgency the President of Belarus clearly stated as far back as five years ago: \u201cWe have consistently highlighted the key role of great powers in this effort. Unfortunately, today they hear and understand each other poorly. There is not the slightest hint that they are ready to move away from the recriminations. Perhaps the time has come for the countries representing the developing world to collectively take the lead on global security with all of the energy and dynamism, which they had displayed with great success nearly half a century ago in advancing the idea of a New International Economic Order. We believe that exactly now the Non-Aligned Movement and BRICS, as well as the regional integration unions are on the rise to get involved directly in matters of global peace.\u201d\n\nVladimir Makei stated that today, unfortunately, there is no clear concept for safeguarding peace and security of our planet insofar as the world has become so complex a structure that a multitude of diverse challenges defy any framework of a single design. \u201cWhat is more, the mechanisms for neutralizing these global challenges that were put in place in the framework of preceding geopolitical realities lag behind with adequate decisions or stall altogether,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe task facing today the whole of humanity's responsible part is to ensure that our civilization would not be destroyed while we transition to a new multipolar world order. This is exactly what must be the area for our common priority action, including at the United Nations. It is in this direction, provided we want to survive at all, where we must seek consensus and promptly forge new adequate response mechanisms. It is for the sake of this objective that we must at once cease mutually destructive rhetoric and put an end to fatal total confrontation that leave no room for diplomatic efforts. It is only up for world leaders with great responsibility to achieve this, for those who, in the figurative expression of Henry Kissinger, \u2018possess a sense of direction and mission'. Leaders of these qualities are bound to emerge on the world stage,\u201d the Belarusian minister said.\n\nHe said in conclusion that the present state of mind was well captured by Martin Luther King more than half a century ago in the following phrase: \u201cWe are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now, in the unfolding life and history. There is such a thing as being too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us act \u2013 lest it becomes too late! Belarus, for its part, stands ready to play a role of a vigorously engaged and responsible stakeholder in security processes at the global and regional levels alike,\u201d Vladimir Makei said.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Belarus' Ministry of Foreign Affairs",

        "content": "President Vladimir Putin\u2019s planned annexation of parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine, after sham referendums there, is at least as dangerous a moment in the war as the marathon televised spectacle that prefaced Russia\u2019s invasion in February.\n\nOf course, things have not gone as Putin planned.\n\nBack in February, he sought to justify the invasion in an angry speech laced with legal verbiage coupled with a pre-recorded show of support from the country\u2019s top brass. The only thing genuine in Putin\u2019s effort to frame the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d as something other than naked aggression was Putin schooling the head of his spy service, Sergei Naryshkin, as he flubbed his script and said he backed the proxy states in east Ukraine becoming part of Russia.\n\nNaryshkin was half a year too early and too mean in his ambition. With its invasion, Russia had planned to swiftly decapitate the political leadership in Kyiv, occupy a huge swath of territory, and exercise influence over a newly friendly Ukraine, perhaps leaving some troops there. Ukraine\u2019s dogged resistance culminating in the lightning recapture of territory in the Kharkiv region has put the Kremlin on the back foot, forcing it to rush forward haphazardly with what has emerged as its plan B.\n\nThe would-be referendums in Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 precursors to a planned formal annexation this week \u2013 were hurried and ugly, held at gunpoint and with shells exploding in the distance. They lacked the Potemkin pageantry of similar so-called ballots in Crimea in 2014, which were at least accompanied by efforts to entice voters with promises of higher pensions and Russian investment.\n\nThis time, in its urgency, the Kremlin appears to have dropped all but the barest attempts to make the referendums look convincing, opting instead for brutality. So why bother at all?\n\nThere was a domestic and an international agenda to the mock vote.\n\nPutin\u2019s main audience is at home. The day after news of the referendums, he ordered a military mobilisation \u2013 a deeply unpopular move that Russia has long avoided despite lacking manpower on the front. Russian disinformation has not always had to be sophisticated to find purchase, but people being asked to kill or die \u2013 or send their loved ones to do so \u2013 are more apt to ask why.\n\nDespite Russia\u2019s harsh crackdown on dissent, protests have erupted across the country and at least 200,000 Russians have fled the country since Putin\u2019s announcement, often spending their life savings on hard-to-get plane tickets out or waiting for hours in queues at the border. Annexation aims, in one pen stroke, to transform the conflict from a faraway, limited \u201cspecial military operation\u201d that Russians could be jailed for even calling a war, into a battle to defend Russia\u2019s own territory, not Ukraine\u2019s.\n\nInternationally, the other objective is to up the ante in the confrontation with Ukraine and its western backers. Putin\u2019s announcement of the mobilisation was accompanied by the threat of nuclear strikes if Ukraine continued to retake its own lands. Putin \u2013 who attaches great importance to the Soviet-style patina of legality he apparently believes the referendums afford, however Kafkaesque \u2013 is aiming to make such threats credible and thus coerce capitulation. They also serve to stoke the false war narrative Russia is spreading via social media and digital diplomacy abroad, where it has had some traction.\n\nAll of this amounts to a dangerous new phase of the war.\n\nUkraine is fighting for its survival. It is not worried about escalation and has no intention of backing down. Its western backers do rightly fear the conflict spiralling into a Nato-Russia standoff. But Putin\u2019s attempts to cow Ukraine will probably galvanise western support at a time when it risked flagging as politicians grapple with inflation and energy woes. So the war will rage on.\n\nPutin has jettisoned diplomacy. While he likes to keep his options open, those are limited. Russia may be preparing its forces for a new offensive in the winter. If it seizes new territories, it could look to repeat the illegitimate referendums there. And it could still, most alarmingly, widen its strike targets in Ukraine or, in a desperate move, act on Putin\u2019s nuclear threat.\n\nUS and European leaders are absolutely right to call out Moscow\u2019s threats as risking catastrophe for Russia itself and to swiftly denounce the referendums as the sham they are, including by introducing a UN resolution. This last, couched as a vote on the principle of territorial integrity, will hopefully garner support from countries in the global south that have been less inclined to take sides.\n\nIt\u2019s a critical moment for the world, including for media, factcheckers and big tech companies, to redouble efforts to counter Russian disinformation. Even reporting on the referendums as if they were any other vote risks lending the kind of legitimising narrative that abetted those politicians sympathetic to Russia or wary of a fight. And, instead of faulting Russians, especially those who have fled rather than fight in a war they don\u2019t agree with, countries should be offering them safe harbour. Doing so deprives Moscow of troops and aligns with every humanitarian principle.\n\nUltimately, western states must continue walking the tightrope between supporting Ukraine and perilous escalation. The more outrageous Russia\u2019s provocations, the more important it will be to respond with the balance of prudence, unity and resolve that has marked the west\u2019s response to date.",

Every human life!\u201d the head of state noted. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why, both earlier and today, with the military conflict raging next to us in Ukraine, we have always come forward with peace initiatives in the international arena and continue doing so. We consider the conflict between the fraternal peoples to be a great tragedy. It is a direct consequence of strategic intrigues and greatest stupidity, primarily of Western politicians.\"\n\n\"The conflict is much discussed today. Many people declare their desire for peace in that land. Especially the Europeans, because the conflict is in our European home. If Europeans genuinely want peace, it can be achieved within days. I have repeatedly stated this and I warn Europeans: please, wise up and do everything to ensure that peace is restored on that land,\" the Belarusian leader urged.\n\nAccording to Aleksandr Lukashenko, Belarus has tried its best to prevent this madness. \u201cNo need to blame us today for co-aggression or anything of the kind. We have always been together with Russia and will remain so. We have a closer alliance with Russia than the NATO bloc has. What do you want from us? At the same time, we reaffirm our commitment to stay out of the war in Ukraine. Let us cooperate peacefully. The Ukrainians have nothing to blame Belarus for. They have nothing to reproach us, Belarusians, for. We did not start the conflict with Ukraine. It was Ukraine who, earlier than any European country and the United States, had closed the sky for our planes and declared an economic blockade of Belarus. Why are you demanding something from us today? We sacredly comply with our agreements with Russia. Everyone in NATO, never mind the United States, knew about it before the conflict. We have never killed anyone and are not going to do this,\u201d the president said.\n\nAccording to Aleksandr Lukashenko, Belarus has always been a supporter of negotiations and hosted three rounds of peaceful talks between Russia and Ukraine. \u201cWhy have those negotiations been terminated. Who decided to do so? The questions are rhetorical. I say this to you, ambassadors, so that you know our position on the most acute modern problem today. We are doing everything possible to stop the bloodshed. But someone needs this bloodshed. Who? You, diplomats, need to figure it out,\u201d the president said.",

        "content": "Germany, the country that ruined the 20th Century, is damaging the 21st. Berlin\u2019s political decisions facilitated Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and now its politicians slow-walk the military assistance and sanctions needed to defeat Russia.\n\nThe most recent example is Germany\u2019s refusal to permit the acquisition by Ukraine of 300 German-made Leopard II battle tanks \u2014 unless and until America also sends M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine.\n\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM! Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\nWashington has declined to send the Abrams because the tank is inferior to the Leopard, costly and cumbersome. Even so, Germany insists. But this is not about tanks.\n\nIt\u2019s about guilt and optics. German politicians worry that it won\u2019t go unnoticed that the last time German tanks moved eastward was in 1941 when Hitler\u2019s \u201cBarbarossa\u201d armada invaded and swept toward Russia using 3,400 tanks that were, like the Leopard II, made by arms giant Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, who was also Nazi Germany\u2019s prime supplier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile eyebrow-raising, these inconvenient historical facts do not justify preventing Ukraine from deploying Leopard tanks to break through Russia\u2019s \u201cMaginot Line\u201d of trenches, landmines, artillery, and cement barriers in its East.\n\nIn this case, as in others, Germany\u2019s mentality and hesitation have been unhelpful and disquieting.\n\nJune 22, 1941. Hitler\u2019s Operation Barbarossa\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also refused to lift re-export restrictions on the 15 countries that currently own 2,000 Leopards, many of whom are willing to ship tanks to Ukraine.\n\nHe worries about Russian retaliation if Germany proceeds on its own, but even after the UK pledged 14 of its big battle tanks to break the deadlock last week Scholz still refused to green light the Leopards. Pressure builds and Poland and other Leopard owners intend to defy restrictions.\n\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted he was \u201ctired of the s@#$%show surrounding who is going to send tanks and when are they going to send them. To the Germans: Send tanks to Ukraine because they need them. It is in your own national interest that Putin loses in Ukraine. To the Biden Administration: Send American tanks so that others will follow our lead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyiv remains confident the Leopards will eventually arrive and has already started training operators. And on Jan. 20, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin downplayed Germany\u2019s tank \u201cpunt\u201d and announced an impressive platform of smaller tanks, infantry fighting vehicles [IFVs], artillery and weaponry for Ukraine to mount its needed spring counter-offensive. \u201cThis is a very, very capable package. The U.S. package represents enough armor to liberate Ukraine or until Putin ends his war of choice.\u201d\n\nA German official hinted on Jan. 22 that Poland could send its Leopards if it requests permission, but damage has been done.\n\nOnce more Germany is a drag on the alliance at a crucial time. Putin cannot win on the battlefield and has decided to prolong the conflict to discourage allies: He now digs in, murders civilians, threatens nuclear attack, and throws tens of thousands of Russian conscripts into action as cannon fodder in order to freeze the war at a point in Eastern Ukraine that is not far from where he began his second occupation on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot coincidentally, on Jan. 17, Putin pal Henry Kissinger issued a statement that recommended talks begin but fighting continue until the \u201cpre-war line\u201d is reached. At that point, a cease-fire can be negotiated, he suggested, along with the future ownership of the Donbas and Crimea. In return, he said he agreed that Ukraine should be allowed to join NATO. This was contemptible claptrap and read like a Kremlin wish list.\n\nUkraine is assembling an armored division of tanks and IFVs that will be capable of liberating all its territory including Crimea by this summer, said Ben Hodges on Jan. 21, former Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe.\n\n\u201cUkraine will continue building up an armored force \u2013 a division or more \u2013 that is trained and prepared to serve as the breakthrough formation for the next major offensive phase of the campaign. I\u2019d anticipate that it\u2019ll be at least three months before they\u2019re able to do that. It will be built around Ukrainian armor that they already have or have captured, but Western tanks, IFVs, and artillery will be key to making it lethal. I can\u2019t be confident of the delivery of tanks to complement the IFVs that are now being delivered, but it does seem that the dam is about to finally break on Western tanks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine also needs long-range missiles to isolate Crimea and neutralize Russia\u2019s ability to kill civilians. \u201cUkraine will never be safe or secure or able to rebuild its economy so long as Russia retains Crimea. Therefore, Kyiv cannot accept any negotiated settlement which gives up Crimea, nor should the West... If we are serious about the international rules-based order then we cannot allow the Kremlin to be rewarded for its illegal actions,\u201d added Hodges.\n\nThe tank fiasco highlights a major impediment within the alliance as well as within the European Union, which is Berlin\u2019s proclivity to put parochial politics ahead of Europe\u2019s or NATO\u2019s best interests \u2014 a stance that disqualifies its standing as a leader.\n\nGermany has vetoed Ukrainian membership in NATO, hesitated to provide timely financial and military support as well as sanctions, and, worst of all, supported Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. That infrastructure, destroyed by Russian saboteurs recently to frighten Europe about its infrastructure vulnerability, was the center piece of Putin\u2019s European conquest strategy.\n\nHe intended to use his pipelines to control Europe\u2019s energy, undermine its security, and bypass Ukraine\u2019s gas delivery system to pave the way for an invasion. In essence, his first \u201cattack\u201d against Europe was to co-opt Germany, which he accomplished after decades of living in East Germany as a KGB agent then courting German politicians from inside the Kremlin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNord Stream 1 and 2 \u2014 both blown up recently by Russia to frighten Europe\n\nIt\u2019s also concerning that Chancellor Scholz is a Social Democratic Party colleague of Gerhard Schroder, a close friend of Putin\u2019s, who served as Chancellor until 2005 then launched the Nord Stream 2 project for Russia in 2011.\n\nSchroder is a bon vivant who has become wealthy after serving for years as a director on Putin\u2019s biggest energy corporations. Discredited over the link, Schroder was stripped of some of his Parliamentary privileges after the invasion.\n\nBut he is close to Scholz\u2019s new German Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, who reportedly also has a relationship with one of Schroder\u2019s ex-wives.\n\nIt\u2019s all very cozy at the top of German politics. Between Schroder\u2019s stint as Chancellor, and Scholz\u2019s, was Angela Merkel who also defended and pushed through Putin\u2019s Nord Stream 2. While doing so, she and her government ignored fierce opposition from Brussels and Washington over the pipeline\u2019s threat to European security, but she displayed the same high-handed behavior that is now under way concerning the tanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exasperated European Parliament last week demanded that Germany release the Leopards \u201cwithout further delay\u201d and its President Charles Michel said \u201cthe time is now. Ukraine needs more military equipment. I firmly support the delivery of tanks.\u201d\n\nPutin and his useful German Chancellors, Merkel and Schroder\n\nAmerica has also been guilty of heeding, and acceding to, German wishes.\n\nIn spring 2021, President Joe Biden backed down from Nord Stream 2 sanctions imposed by Congress to stop the pipeline, at Merkel\u2019s request, months before the invasion. In a powerful Foreign Affairs piece on Jan. 20, chess champion and Putin foe Garry Kasparov, urged Biden to \u201cdeliver the knockout punch\u201d and ignore fears propagated by Germans and others that a destabilized, defeated Russia must be avoided at all costs.\n\n\u201cThe end of Putin\u2019s tyrannical rule will indeed radically change Russia (and the rest of the world) \u2014 but not in the way the White House thinks. Rather than destabilizing Russia and its neighbors, a Ukrainian victory would eliminate a powerful revanchist force and boost the cause of democracy worldwide.\u201d\n\nRussia deserves no mercy, and Ukrainians cannot, and won\u2019t, surrender to an evil government that\u2019s abused them for centuries and now executes a genocidal, \u201cscorched earth\u201d armed catastrophe.\n\nNor should the West. Putin must be forced to completely withdraw behind Ukraine\u2019s 1991 borders and Russia forced to pay reparations. Kasparov also urged haste: \u201cThis is a make-or-break moment for Ukraine. Biden can turn the tide in Kyiv\u2019s favor by backing up his declarations of support with the delivery of tanks and long-range weaponry. He can also hasten the demise of Putin\u2019s regime, opening up the possibility of a democratic future for Russia and demonstrating to the world the folly of military aggression.\u201d\n\nOnce again in history, Germany is on thin ice.\n\nInstead of marching in lockstep with the alliance of civilized nations committed to defeating Putin, Berlin falters.\n\nIt has already fallen for Putin\u2019s dangerous pitches in the past but now retracts into timidity and self-absorption. It is a great nation with incredible talent, but must become a team player. Fooled once, shame on Moscow. Fooled twice, shame on Berlin.\n\nReprinted with the author\u2019s permission from Diane Francis Newsletter on America and the World: https://dianefrancis.substack.com/about\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.",

Moreover, the attempted annexation of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, following the illegal so-called referendums organised by the Russian Federation in these regions in September 2022, is a further escalation of the aggression against Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Federation will be considered as continuing its aggression as long as the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders will be fully re-established. The Assembly recalls that the ongoing aggression is a continuation of the aggression started on 20 February 2014, which included the invasion, occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation,\u201d reads the resolution.\n\nPACE also notes that \u201cBelarus has participated in the Russian Federation\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, as it has allowed its territory to be used by the Russian Federation for perpetrating acts of aggression against Ukraine. Its role and complicity should be condemned by the international community and its leaders should be held to account.\u201d\n\nPointing out that the unprovoked acts of aggression committed by the Russian Federation and Belarus constitute manifest violations of the Charter of the United\n\nNations and lack any plausible legal justification, PACE underscores that \u201cthese acts therefore meet the definition of the crime of aggression as set out in Article 8 bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and under customary international law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Russian and Belarusian political and military leaders who planned, prepared, initiated or executed these acts, and who were in a position to control or direct the political or military action of the State, should be identified and prosecuted. Without their decision to wage this war of aggression against Ukraine, the atrocities that flow from it (war crimes, crimes against humanity and possible genocide), as well as all the destruction, death and damage resulting from the war, including from lawful acts of war, would not have occurred,\u201d reads the resolution.\n\nNoting that the ICC does not have at present jurisdiction over the crime of aggression\n\ncommitted against Ukraine and that there is no other international criminal tribunal competent to prosecute and punish the crime of aggression committed against\n\nUkraine, PACE reiterates its call on the Council of Europe member States and observer States to \u201cset up a special international criminal tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, which should be endorsed and supported by as many States and international organisations as possible, and in particular by the United Nations General Assembly.\u201d\n\nAs reported, PACE members called on the leaders of the Council of Europe member states at the summit in May to lead the initiative to create a special international criminal tribunal for the crime of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, as well as to support the creation of an international compensation mechanism for damages caused during the aggression.\n\nol",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin has compared Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the fight against Nazi Germany, in a speech to mark the 80th anniversary of the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad.\n\nCiting Germany's decision to send tanks to Ukraine, the Russian president said history was repeating itself.\n\n\"It's unbelievable but true,\" he said. \"We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks.\"\n\nGermany is one of many countries helping Ukraine defend its territory.\n\nRussia launched its bloody, full-scale invasion almost one year ago, prompting Western countries to send weapons and aid to the government in Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking in Volgograd - the modern name for Stalingrad - Mr Putin hinted that he could seek to move beyond conventional weapons.\n\n\"Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield do not understand, it seems, that a modern war with Russia will be very different for them,\" the 70-year-old leader said. \"We are not sending our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond. It won't be limited to the use of armoured hardware. Everyone must understand this.\"\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on Mr Putin's comments but did tell reporters that \"as new weapons are delivered by the collective West, Russia will make greater use of its potential to respond\".\n\nMr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of World War Two's Battle of Stalingrad, which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops in a major turning point of the war.\n\nOver a million people perished in the battle - the bloodiest of the conflict.\n\nVolgograd was temporarily renamed Stalingrad for the day to mark the anniversary, and earlier this week a new bust of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unveiled.\n\nStalin - who led the Soviet Union between 1924 and his death in 1953 - was accused of orchestrating a famine in Ukraine between 1932-33.\n\nThe event - called the Holodomor by Ukrainians - killed an estimated five million people and was recognised as a genocide earlier this week in Bulgaria.\n\nThroughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia's invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he says are leading the Kyiv government.\n\nAnd he returned to the theme throughout his speech.\n\n\"Now, unfortunately, we see that the ideology of Nazism, already in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, again creates direct threats to the security of our country,\" he said.\n\n\"Again and again we have to repel the aggression of the collective West.\"\n\nBut he vowed that while it was \"unbelievable but true\" that Russia was again being threatened by German tanks, Moscow had an answer for any country that threatened it.\n\nBerlin has agreed to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, prompting the Russian company Fores - a Urals-based energy industry firm - to offer five million roubles (\u00a358,250) to the first Russian soldier to destroy or capture one.\n\nMr Putin also laid flowers at the grave of the Soviet marshal who oversaw the defence of the city, and visited the main memorial complex where he led a moment of silence for those that died in the battle.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of Volgograd residents lined the city's streets to watch a military parade.\n\nAs planes roared overhead, modern and World War Two-era tanks rolled along the centre of the city. Some of the modern vehicles were marked with the letter Z, which has become the symbol of Russia's invasion.\n\nLocal media reported that regional Governor Andrey Bocharov - who accompanied Mr Putin to the memorial complex - was not at the parade. He had not been seen since 24 January, leading to speculation that he was isolating before meeting the president.\n\nElsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was preparing to take \"revenge\" against the West for aiding Ukraine.\n\n\"Now Russia is concentrating its forces. We all know that. It is preparing to try to take revenge, not only against Ukraine, but against a free Europe and the free world,\" Mr Zelensky said in Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said Russia was \"increasing the pace of adaptation to sanctions\" and urged the EU leader to impose additional restrictions on the Russian economy.\n\nLater, addressing the National Prayer Breakfast in the US via videolink, Mr Zelensky thanked US President Joe Biden for his support and set Ukrainian forces a goal of defeating the Russian invasion in the next year.\n\n\"We must do everything we can together so that next year - on the first Thursday of February - we will be able to pray simply with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil,\" Mr Zelensky said.",

        "content": "Heroic rhetoric has its moment in every conflict. \u201cWe have freedom, give us wings to protect it,\u201d cried Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in pleading support from the nations of Europe in Westminster Hall on Wednesday. He faces a renewed battle to drive Russian tanks off his land \u2013 all his land \u2013 in the spring. His cause is just and it is desperate. He now wants jets.\n\nAt such a time, war has all the best tunes. It ridicules argument, honours danger and jeers at caution. Over the past year, the western powers under Nato auspices have struggled to contain the battles in Ukraine from escalating into precisely what cold war theorists most feared. That is a destabilisation of the balance of power in Europe, leading to a widespread and catastrophic conflict.\n\nThey have so far succeeded. Russia\u2019s outrageous bid to occupy and conquer all of Ukraine has been resisted. The line of contact with Russian forces has withdrawn into the Donbas region in the east, roughly the territory occupied by Russia with local support in 2014. Escalation has been avoided largely because western weapons have not deliberately been deployed on Russian soil. Nato has enabled Ukraine to put up a valiant resistance. The reason has not been to preserve western security but rather out of respect for its cruelly assaulted sovereignty. It is not a respect the west has always shown, as in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.\n\nAt some stage in any war, interests will diverge. Russia wishes to see western support for Ukraine as a Nato aggression, a view partly validated by the west\u2019s global economic sanctions and fierce ostracism of all things Russian. It sometimes seems as if London and Washington were eager to support Vladimir Putin\u2019s paranoia.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine has an interest in responding in kind. It demands that Russia be seen as a threat to all of Europe and the world. It rejects the danger of nuclear escalation as an idle threat. Emboldened by western weaponry, it now wants Russia driven out of all of Ukraine. Military experts say this would require a long-term and massive western commitment, possibly including manpower on the ground. It would end Nato\u2019s determination to avoid the war leading to any \u201ckinetic conflict\u201d with Russia. It would certainly split the alliance. None of this stops politicians such as Boris Johnson, with agendas of their own, from seeking headlines with much backslapping and Churchillian talk of \u201ctotal victory\u201d.\n\nDiscussing peace at this juncture in a war meets a depressingly familiar response. Compromise is seen as capitulation. When you can bask in the applause of Westminster and Buckingham Palace, why risk humiliation around some Black Sea negotiating table? Both sides feel they can summon more resources, crucially western ones in the case of Kyiv. There is always scope for just \u201cone more push\u201d.\n\nThe only sensible way out of this conflict has degenerated to the near unmentionable. It is the re-establishment of some version of the 2021 border arrived at \u2013 and accepted by Kyiv and European representatives \u2013 under the Minsk agreement after 2014. We know that it proved a dead letter, and was monstrously overridden by Russia\u2019s subsequent invasion. But as in all wars, sooner or later some deal must be reached on the basis of some existing balance of power.\n\nThat is what should dominate the debate over Zelenskiy\u2019s request for new planes. Military experts explain that they cannot conceivably be in use by the coming spring, indeed possibly not this year. Ukrainian pilots cannot be trained to fly them, nor ground facilities built to handle them. Jets cannot occupy territory and, as bombers, would be allowed only to bomb forces in Ukraine. They are of limited tactical use. This spring, anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences would be far more useful, as should be the arrival of western tanks.\n\nIn other words, a supply of jets would be more an escalation of support than of military reinforcement. It might supposedly suggest to Putin that his war is not going to go away and he should sue for peace. Equally it might do the opposite. He, or any harder-liners who would displace him, might respond with a nuclear deployment or a savage air attack on Kyiv. This might escalate to the arrival of western pilots and attacks bases in Russia. Either way it would blatantly risk a lethal escalation without real help to Ukraine on the ground. It would certainly split western governments and people.\n\nThat is why the jets gamble cannot be worth it. Better by far to help Zelenskiy gain battlefield advantage in the coming spring as a basis for a sustained effort for peace. So far the west has kept an impressive degree of control over this appalling conflict. It cannot surrender that control at such a critical juncture.",

That somehow the rise of a totalitarian China is inevitable. But I reject this fatalism. And the free world has a significant role to play in whether or not that happens \u2013 and how it happens.\u201d\n\nXi drew widespread condemnation last summer after Chinese forces held large-scale military drills near Taiwan, soon after the then US speaker, Nancy Pelosi, visited the self-governing island. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has vowed to reunite it with the motherland.\n\n\u201cWe know that President Xi has been very clear \u2013 it\u2019s his ambition for China to have control of Taiwan and in my view that would be disastrous,\u201d Truss said. \u201cThe message needs to be heard loud and clear in Beijing that these incursions are not acceptable.\u201d\n\nShe called for a more developed Pacific defence alliance and deeper economic integration with Taiwan to prevent conflict, saying Britain\u2019s attempts to court Xi in 2015 were a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe rolled out the red carpet for the Chinese president \u2013 with all the pomp and ceremony that came with a state visit,\u201d she said. \u201cI should know \u2013 I attended a banquet in his honour. Looking back, I think this sent the wrong message.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was a \u201cstark reminder\u201d of how authoritarian regimes are emboldened when countries fail to act early against acts of aggression, she said.\n\nMorrison, who had earlier likened the west\u2019s \u201cappeasement\u201d of China to the Munich agreement with Hitler, asked Truss during a panel session why the energy crisis in Europe triggered by the war in Ukraine had not made countries think twice about deepening their engagement with China on trade given the global economic fallout that would result from a conflict in the Taiwan strait, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping routes.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to believe the worst will happen,\u201d Truss said. \u201cThat is part of what we are seeing with China.\u201d",

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\n- Chapter 1: full-scale invasion -\n\nAt dawn on February 24, 2022, after repeatedly denying plans to invade Ukraine, Putin announces a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise and \"de-Nazify\" the former Soviet country.\n\nHe says he is acting to protect people in two self-proclaimed pro-Russian territories in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine from \"genocide\" but provides no proof of his allegations.\n\nA full-scale invasion begins, with missile strikes on several Ukrainian cities and ground forces entering the country from the north, south and east.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stays in the capital Kyiv to lead the resistance, despite the United States warning that Russia is out to \"decapitate\" his government.\n\nThe invasion, which comes after frantic diplomatic efforts to keep Putin at the negotiating table, causes an international outcry.\n\nThe West imposes unprecedented sanctions on Russia and progressively ramps them up.\n\nThe European Union agrees to send weapons to Ukraine -- a first for the bloc -- and the United States greenlights billions of dollars in military aid.\n\nRussian forces make rapid gains on Ukraine's south coast, seizing the Black Sea port of Kherson, close to the Russian-occupied Crimea peninsula, and the port of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nMoscow's troops also attempt to encircle Kyiv and heavily bombard Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, near the Russian border.\n\n- Chapter 2: horror in Bucha -\n\nA month into the fighting, having failed to break through to Kyiv, the Russian army withdraws from northern Ukraine to focus on the east and south.\n\nAs Moscow's forces retreat from the western suburbs of Kyiv, they leave behind scenes of horror.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn April 2, AFP discovers the bodies of at least 20 civilians, some with their hands tied behind their backs, lying on a single street in the northwestern Kyiv suburb of Bucha.\n\nOver the following weeks, hundreds more bodies, many bearing signs of torture, are found in homes, cellars and shallow graves across the north.\n\nRussia is accused of widespread war crimes, which it denies.\n\nChapter 3: the battle for Mariupol -\n\nOn April 21, Russia claims to have taken the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been relentlessly bombarded since the start of the war and subjected to a brutal siege.\n\nIn capturing the city, Russia aims to link up rebel-held territory in the Donbas with the occupied Crimea peninsula to the south.\n\nAround 2,000 Ukrainian fighters hold out for nearly a month in the city's sprawling Azovstal steelworks before being ordered in May by Kyiv to surrender to the Russians to save their lives.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian government, 90 percent of Mariupol has been razed in the war and at least 20,000 people killed.\n\n- Chapter 4: Ukraine fights back -\n\nOver the summer, the United States and EU step up their supplies of heavy weapons to Kyiv, allowing it to stage a two-pronged fightback.\n\nIn the south, Ukrainian forces launch a major offensive to retake Kherson in late August.\n\nThey follow up in early September with a lightning counter-offensive around Kharkiv in the northeast, winning back hundreds of towns and villages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith his army losing ground, Putin announces a call-up of some 300,000 reservists, a move that sparks an exodus of young men of fighting age to neighbouring countries.\n\nDays later he formally annexes four regions of Ukraine -- Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- after staging local referendums on joining Russia that are dismissed by Kyiv and the West as a sham.\n\nOn November 9, Russia's forces suffer their greatest setback in the war when they are forced to abandon Kherson.\n\nUkrainian forces are greeted as liberators when they arrive days later.\n\n- Chapter 5: darkest winter -\n\nIn October, Russia changes tack and turns its sights to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which it targets with repeated barrages of missile and drone strikes.\n\nThe attacks leave millions without power and heat for hours at a time in the middle of winter.\n\nIn January, Russian forces backed by the controversial Wagner mercenary group step up their offensive on the Donetsk town of Bakhmut, at the centre of the longest and bloodiest battle of the war.\n\nZelensky repeatedly appeals to the West to send tanks.\n\nGermany, which had been wary of escalating the conflict, finally relents to send some of its powerful Leopard tanks, opening the way for other European countries to do so as well.",

Today, it must be done for a new century, including UN reform, while the cost of conflict is fading from most European memories.\u201d\n\nThe treaty of Versailles, signed in Paris in 1919, was seen as humiliating by many Germans, and some historians argue that it created an enduring bitterness that helped the Nazis rise to power.\n\nBut Welby also urged world leaders not to force Ukraine into an \u201cunjust peace\u201d, as he spoke about the impact of visiting Kyiv.\n\nHIs comments came as Rishi Sunak is to urge allies to \u201cmove faster\u201d in arming Ukraine, during a meeting of world leaders to mark the invasion anniversary.\n\nSunak will lead the UK in a minute\u2019s silence at 11am and will meet leaders of G7 nations to discuss the conflict that has scarred Europe and shaken the west.\n\nHe is expected to tell the G7 leaders in a virtual meeting: \u201cFor Ukraine to win this war \u2013 and to accelerate that day \u2013 they must gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield. That is what it will take to shift Putin\u2019s mindset. This must be our priority now. Instead of an incremental approach, we need to move faster on artillery, armour, and air defence.\n\n\u201cThe coming weeks will be difficult for Ukraine, but they will also be difficult for Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his administration made no statements relating to the anniversary even though Putin has made numerous public appearances over the past three days.\n\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM! Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made inflammatory claims that Russia will win the war and reiterated that it is vital for Russia to achieve its goals to \"push back the borders that threaten [Russia] as far as possible, even if they are the borders of Poland.\" ISW has previously assessed that the Kremlin has been using Medvedev to sustain information campaigns targeting Western military support for Ukraine and to deflect attention from Russia's military failures. Medvedev's statements highlight the fact that the Kremlin is continuing to pursue its unrealistic maximalist goals even though it has no meaningful successes to offer the Russian people after a year of costly war in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelect Russian milbloggers commented on the Kremlin's silence on the first anniversary of the war. Russian former officer and an avid Kremlin critic Igor Girkin criticized Medvedev's statements as delusional and lamented the fact that no one remembers the severe losses Russian airborne troops suffered during the fight for Hostomel Airfield near Kyiv on Feb. 24, 2022. Girkin claimed that he had long been forecasting that Russia had embarked upon a protracted and exhausting war. He noted that it is very difficult to defeat a state that receives external support using Russia's unmotivated forces, absent civil society, and strong brainwashing.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nA Kremlin-affiliated milblogger attempted to downplay Russia's military failures expressing thanks that the war revealed shortcomings but distress at the high price paid in Russian blood. The milblogger also amplified the Kremlin's false narrative that the war was necessary to stop supposed Ukrainian \"aggression\" in Donbas. The milblogger's statements closely mirror comments made by unnamed Kremlin-affiliated officials to Financial Times who noted that Putin will try to frame Russia's catastrophic military failures as a necessary learning experience that Russia will use to prepare for future supposed NATO aggression against Russia that Putin purportedly fears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\u00b7 The Kremlin did not comment on the first anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, likely because Russia has failed to achieve any of its stated objectives and has not made significant territorial gains since July 2022.\n\n\u00b7 A Russian source capitalized on China's release of a 12-point peace plan to inaccurately portray China as supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\u00b7 US intelligence reportedly continues to assess that China is seriously considering sending lethal aid to Russia amid continued pressure from Western sanctions regimes on Russia's defense industrial base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00b7 Western governments made a variety of statements on the provision of military aid to Ukraine on February 24.\n\n\u00b7 The Kremlin escalated its information condition-setting for a possible false-flag operation in occupied Transnistria, Moldova.\n\n\u00b7 Russian forces continued to conduct ground attacks northwest of Svatove and near Kreminna.\n\n\u00b7 Russian sources confirmed that Russian forces have split certain Airborne (VDV) force formations across at least two axes of advance.\n\n\u00b7 Russian forces made marginal territorial gains around Bakhmut and continued to conduct ground attacks across the Donetsk Oblast front line.\n\n\u00b7 Ukrainian officials suggested that Russian forces may feel insecure in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast.\n\n\u00b7 Russian authorities continue measures to expand the capacity of Russian peacekeepers.\n\n\u00b7 Russian sources likely attempted to shift the blame for scandals associated with Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) commanders to the conventional Russian military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00b7 Ukrainian partisans likely blew up a railway segment near Poshtove, Crimea.\n\nAuthors: Riley Bailey, Grace Mappes, Layne Philipson, Kateryna Stepanenko, Karolina Hird, George Barros, and Frederick W.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\n\"It certainly doesn't show signs of being close to the end,\" said Jon Alterman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank.\n\n\"Each side feels that time is on its side and settling now is a mistake.\"\n\nThe Russian side, after some recent successes in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, may well be preparing a spring offensive, experts believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Ukraine appears determined to win back lost territory, aided by US and European governments whose support for Kyiv seems to be growing.\n\nIt has even made clear its intention to win back control of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014 -- an ambition that has sparked some wariness in the West.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris earlier this month that he was \"determined to help Ukraine to victory\".\n\n- 'Good enough' victory? -\n\nBut that doesn't mean that the war necessarily ends with a clear Russian defeat, said Liana Fix at the Council on Foreign Relations, another US think tank.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\n\"I think the most likely scenario is Ukrainian gains leading to 'a good enough' victory,\" she said, followed by \"continuous fighting in some territories\", as Russia tries to hold on to Crimea.\n\nRussia may have the potential to mobilise large amounts of new soldiers, but they would have to be trained, fed and supplied with equipment -- tasks the Russian army has been \"really bad at so far in this war\", she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat type of arms Ukraine manages to get from its western allies will be decisive, said Dimitri Minic at the French Institute for International Relations.\n\nLonger-range artillery, for example, \"could allow the Ukrainian army to break the cycle of attack, counter-attack and defence, weaken Russia's capacity to recover and obtain a decisive victory\", he said.\n\nA \"strategic\" win, he said, could consist of \"splitting the Russian army deployment in Ukraine in two via Zaporizhzhia\", a city and region in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nBut, Minic cautioned, even when Ukraine inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Russian army by recapturing the southern city of Kherson, Moscow did not give up.\n\n- 'Will do anything' -\n\n\"The Russians will do anything, including mobilising without limit and impoverishing their entire country if needed, to hold on to occupied territories and continue their conquests,\" Minic said.\n\nAlterman said he could imagine multiple scenarios, such as \"Russia exhausting the rest of the world and solidifying some gains.\"\n\n\"I could imagine a leadership transition in Russia that ends the war. I could imagine some sort of truce,\" but he acknowledged that \"it's all too early to say\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, neither side has signalled any real willingness to negotiate.\n\nZelensky has put forward a 10-point peace plan involving a recognition by Russia of Ukraine's territorial integrity, and a withdrawal of all its troops.\n\nRussia could \"temporarily\" accept Ukraine's independence and even a pro-EU and pro-NATO leadership in Kyiv, but only \"in exchange for a recognition of Russian conquests in Ukraine\", said Minic.\n\nThis, however, is a red line Ukraine will never cross, experts said.\n\n- Threat of atomic weapons -\n\nAnother uncertainty concerns nuclear weapons and their possible role in the next phase of the war.\n\nRussia brandished a thinly veiled threat of atomic weapons early in the conflict. While that turned out to be \"a bluff\", according to Fix, a nuclear scenario could become a \"very serious possibility\" if Ukraine should manage to take back Crimea, Minic said.\n\nIf things get that far, he said, internal dissent in Russia may well boil over because of fears of nuclear war -- and because any use of nuclear weapons would be seen as revealing not President Vladimir Putin's strength, but his weakness, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin has been seen as facing pressure within Russia but from an even more bellicose and hardline faction led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner militia outfit.\n\nElectoral events could have a huge influence over the future of the war, including a general election in Ukraine in October, and next year's presidential vote in the United States.\n\nFor this year, US support is assured, but congressional approval of a new aid programme for Ukraine is not a foregone conclusion, Fix said.\n\nSome allied governments in Europe could also face voter fatigue and political opposition against the war if it drags on.\n\n\"There will be more difficulty to explain why this war continues,\" she added.\n\n\"We have to accept that in 2023 we need to see some major advances and victories of Ukraine.\"",

        "content": "The pressure of Ukraine and the world on the terrorist state of Russia will be continued.\n\nThe relevant statement was made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his video address, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.\n\nThe full text of the speech is provided below:\n\nGood health to you, fellow Ukrainians!\n\nToday, we are ending this week with a strong diplomatic event - for the first time in 32 years, a high-level delegation from Saudi Arabia visited Ukraine.\n\nThis is yet another sign of respect for Ukraine, for our invincibility and strength. Respect of the world.\n\nMonday \u2013 the leader of the United States of America, President Joe Biden, was in Kyiv. Director of the International Monetary Fund was in Kyiv.\n\nTuesday \u2013 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was in Kyiv. And a powerful delegation from the U.S. Congress - representatives of the Republican Party - was also in Kyiv.\n\nWednesday - a conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The first conversation in the history of bilateral relations with the President of Uganda. A conversation with the President of Pakistan. A conversation with the President of Estonia.\n\nThursday - Spanish Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez was in Kyiv. A conversation with the President of Egypt. A visit of representatives of the global parliamentary network \"United for Ukraine\". These are 13 European states\u2019 parliaments and the European Parliament. Finally, a historically significant vote of the UN General Assembly in favor of our resolution on peace and territorial integrity of our country. 141 countries endorsed it!\n\nFriday, the anniversary of invincibility - Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki was in Kyiv, and Leopards, modern battle tanks, arrived in Ukraine. The result we have been working on for many, many months. The meeting of the G7 leaders and Ukraine's participation in this meeting. Over the past year, Ukraine has become a traditional participant in top international formats.\n\nNow I had another good meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was the first official visit of such level by a representative of this country. Of course, we are working on a higher level of visits and relations. But now we have finally reached an interaction.\n\nAnd this, by the way, brings concrete and sensitive results for Ukrainians, in particular with regard to the release of prisoners of war. I thank our Saudi partners for their cooperation and assistance.\n\nThis is one week. And again and again, it's about strengthening our state, our soldiers, our steadfastness, our international positions.\n\nToday, I met with representatives of our Ukrainian television, the Ukrainian telethon \"United News\". Journalists, editors, producers. It was a meaningful online meeting. The reason for the meeting is the anniversary of the telethon and gratitude to everyone who works in it.\n\nBut the content was much broader. We talked about intensifying the information work of our state and society. This especially concerns those parts of the world where our diplomacy has not been represented for many decades for various reasons.\n\nAnd now we have to make sure that we are as powerful as possible in terms of information and diplomacy. We need to make Ukraine's position absolutely clear in all parts of the world. This is important in our work to ensure the de-occupation of the territory and our planned active actions.\n\nThe more people know about Ukraine, the more they understand Ukraine, the more they support Ukraine, the closer our victory becomes.\n\nI once again thank everyone who works in the telethon, who creates this information foundation of our national unity.\n\nThank you for your dedication to the Ukrainian cause, for your sincere desire to find and develop formats that will strengthen the telethon and, therefore, Ukraine.\n\nAnd I thank you for your constant search for new methods of work for those who are now in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, for finding new ways to access our people in Donetsk, Luhansk, the south of the country, and Crimea.\n\nIt is very important that Russia has not succeeded in closing off our people and our land informationally in the part of Ukraine where the terrorists' tricolor is still present. We have to do everything we can - and we will do everything to ensure that our people have more access to truthful information.\n\nToday, on February 26, we mark the Day of Resistance to the Occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol. And today this conversation is especially important. It is about ensuring an understanding through information and all other means that Ukraine will not abandon anyone, will not leave anyone to the enemy. We will return all our people and everything ours from Russian captivity.\n\nIn 2014, Russian aggression began with the seizure of Crimea. It is logical that by liberating Crimea, we will put a historic end to any attempts by Russia to ruin the lives of Ukrainians and all the peoples of Europe and Asia that the Kremlin once claimed to conquer.\n\nInternational law will prevail here, on the lands of Ukraine: in Donbas, Pryazovia, Kherson region and Crimea.\n\nI thank everyone who brings this victory closer! I thank everyone who helps our people in the temporarily occupied territory!\n\nGlory to each and every one who is now in combat!\n\nBy the way, today I am especially grateful to our guys from the 110th separate mechanized brigade who shot down another enemy aircraft near Avdiivka!\n\nGlory to all our heroes of resistance in the temporarily occupied territory! All of Ukraine will be free!\n\nAnd one more thing. Today we have new decisions of our state on sanctions against those who are involved or help Russia wage war and destroy lives and people.\n\nI signed three decrees to implement the NSDC decisions. Against those Russians who are involved in the abduction of Ukrainian children. Against those representatives of the Russian sports sector who are trying to put sports in the service of aggression. And against those who help maintain mercenary structures in Russia for the war against Ukraine and all free people.\n\nUkraine's pressure will continue. The world's pressure on the terrorist state will continue.\n\nGlory to Ukraine!",

        "content": "The establishment of real peace in Ukraine is possible only if Kyiv restores control of all the territories occupied by Russia.\n\n\"Forcing Ukraine to betray part of her citizenry would not be just, nor would it bring peace. Such \"agreements\" only lay the foundations of the next conflict. That is why we ask Ukraine's allies to commit fully to a complete Ukrainian victory. This is the only true option,\" Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Gabrielius Landsbergis posted on Twitter, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.\n\nHe emphasized that \u201cwe all want peace in Ukraine, but a lasting peace cannot be based on myths.\u201d With this in mind, the minister debunked several myths about a potential peace deal.\n\nAs noted, the first myth is that Ukraine is unable to win back all territory including Crimea. \"Reality: Ukrainians have shown repeatedly that they can restore territorial integrity, given the necessary weapons and training. Our support can be decisive. The ball is in our court,\" the minister wrote.\n\nAccording to him, the second myth claims that Russia is unbeatable. \"Reality: Ukraine\u2019s allies have only committed a tiny fraction of their resources. Manufacture can be ramped up. The combined Nordic-Baltic GDP alone is bigger than Russia\u2019s. Russia could and should be defeated,\" Landsbergis stressed.\n\nThe third myth is that Russia will get tired and want to settle. \"Putin's goals have not changed. He still believes he can achieve them. He will only settle as a timeout before the next aggression. He will keep reigniting the conflict. He announced a crusade, so he cannot stop,\" Landsbergis noted.\n\nHe further debunks the myth that Crimea is a red line for Putin. \"Putin has announced many red lines. He threatened huge consequences if Ukraine\u2019s allies sent any help at all, but his red lines keep evaporating. Internationally agreed borders must be respected without fear. Crimea is Ukraine,\" Lithuania\u2019s top diplomat underscored.\n\nLandsbergis also does not agree that the world can go back to business as usual with Putin. \" Putin is far too heavily invested in his crusade against the West. He cannot turn back. He sees our peace offerings as weakness and uses them against us. He should be in court, not in power,\" he noted.\n\nAccording to the minister, the sixth myth is that all wars end with negotiations. \"WWII didn\u2019t end with negotiations. Peace can only be sustainable if Putin is defeated. Ongoing negotiations with Putin would lead only to recurring conflict. Swift, full victory is the only guarantee of lasting peace,\" he stated.\n\nFinally, Landsbergis debunks the myth that the Baltics and Poland only want revenge. \" Reality: After centuries of Russian aggression we want security. We know we cannot expect security without a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. It's simple: Peace means respecting borders,\" he concluded.",

He also endorsed Belarus in becoming a full member of the China and Russia-led SCO, where it is currently an observer state.\n\nSpeaking the same day from Uzbekistan, which is also a SCO member, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d by \u201cputting itself out as a force for peace in public,\u201d while it continues to \u201cfuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.\u201d\n\nBlinken said that there are \u201csome positive elements\u201d of China\u2019s peace proposal but accused China of doing the opposite of supporting peace in Ukraine \u201cin terms of its efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war blocking and tackling for Russia.\u201d\n\nHe also repeated Western concerns that China is considering providing Russia with lethal aid and later said he had no plans to meet with Russian or Chinese counterparts at a G20 meeting for foreign ministers scheduled to take place in New Delhi in India on March 2.\n\nLukashenko said he fully supports Beijing's \"recent\" security initiative days after it released a 12-point position on Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian Presidency\n\nThe tightening of ties between Minsk and Beijing also comes alongside a years-long decline in Belarus\u2019 relations with the West.\n\nThe former Soviet state was targeted by sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies in response to Moscow\u2019s aggression after Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border north of Kyiv.\n\nThe European Union also does not recognize the results of Lukashenko\u2019s 2020 election win \u2013 which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the country and were followed by a brutal government crackdown. The US has also called the election \u201cfraudulent.\u201d\n\nThere have been fears throughout the conflict in Ukraine that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another Russian offensive, or that Lukashenko\u2019s own troops would join the war. Before visiting Moscow earlier this month, Lukashenko claimed there is \u201cno way\u201d his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked.\n\nLike China, Belarus has previously implied that the US does not want to see an end to the conflict.\n\nIn comments to reporters earlier this month before heading to Moscow to meet with Putin, Lukashenko maintained he wanted to see \u201cpeaceful negotiations\u201d and accused the United States of preventing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from negotiating.\n\n\u201cThe US are the only ones who need this slaughter, only they want it,\u201d he said.",

He made no direct reference to the war in Ukraine but acknowledged that discussions would be affected by geopolitical tensions.\n\nThursday's schedule included sessions on food security, development co-operation, terrorism and humanitarian assistance - a reflection of India's priorities while it holds the G20 presidency.\n\nBefore the talks a former Indian diplomat told the BBC India would have to \"do something special\" to make delegates overlook their differences on the war. Strained relations between the US and China, which has refused to oppose Russia's invasion, were also expected to test India's ability to forge a consensus.\n\nIn the end Foreign Minister Jaishankar had to present what's called a chair's summary after Thursday's talks, meaning participants had been unable to reach a joint statement. Russia and China were the only states which refused to agree to condemn the war.\n\nBut India did succeed in its main objective of raising a voice for the Global South and Mr Jaishankar said that \"on the bulk of issues we were able to get an outcome document\".\n\nThere are still several months left for diplomacy before G20 leaders meet in September and Delhi will hope it its presidency doesn't end on a disappointing note.\n\nExperts say Delhi also had the delicate task of balancing its non-aligned policy on the war with pleas to other nations to find ways to work together.\n\nIndia has resisted pressure and continued with its strategy of not directly criticising Russia, which is India's largest supplier of arms. It has regularly abstained from voting on UN resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, including a vote held at the UN General Assembly last week.\n\nIt has also defended its decision to increase its oil imports from Russia, saying it has to look after the needs of its population.\n\nBut it has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\" in its past statements on Ukraine.\n\nAdditional reporting by Leila Nathoo\n\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

Russian leaders have so far avoided taking action that would expand the conflict beyond the borders of Ukraine, but the risk of escalation remains significant\" - wrote in the report.According to the American intelligence, the attack on Ukraine reduced the likelihood of Moscow's military intervention in other post -Soviet countries.\n\nThe report stated that the war that had been going on since February 24 last year weakened \"Air and Land conventional abilities of Moscow and increased dependence on nuclear weapons.\"It was emphasized that the Russian forces would need years to rebuild after the losses they experienced in Ukraine.Therefore, \"Russia will depend on nuclear weapons, cybernetics and space.\"\n\nThe interview reminds that in late summer last year, as a result of failures in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin publicly warned that Russia was ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia.\"Moscow is still developing long -range rockets that are able to carry nuclear weapons,\" we read.According to the Russian authorities, this, as emphasized in the report, has the opportunity to deter opponents.\n\nThe director of the US national intelligence Avril Haines also presented her intelligence assessments on Wednesday during interrogations in the American Senate.She emphasized that the authorities in the Kremlin believe in a military victory in Ukraine.\n\nAvril Haines: Putin most likely calculates that time works in his favor\n\nThe director of the National Intelligence said that although Russia makes gradual progress in the Bachmut region, its armed forces struggle with large losses, staff shortages, ammunition deficiency, low morale and command dysfunction.- We do not anticipate that the Russian army regained enough strength this year to make larger territorial achievements, but Vladimir Putin most likely calculates that time works in his favor - said Avril Haines.She added that Ukraine also faces many challenges, and the success of the spring offensive will depend on many factors.In the opinion of the US intelligence services, Russia's nuclear threats are aimed at scaring the West from granting Ukraine additional support.- Probably Vladimir Putin is still convinced that Russia can ultimately defeat Ukraine, and wants to prevent Western support to tip the scales and forced the conflict with NATO - added the US national intelligence director.At the same time, she assessed that the invasion of Ukraine weakened Russia and made her even more dependent on China",

Kirby said the U.S. expects Russian actors to help train and influence street demonstrations against the sitting government.\n\n\"Moscow is using its propaganda to deepen public dissatisfaction for [Moldovan President] Maia Sandu\u2019s government and stop Moldova from getting closer to the EU,\" Natia Seskuria, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Regime change and installation of a pro-Russian government would be the most effective tool for Moscow to keep Moldova within its sphere of influence. Organizing the coup would be a way to achieve these goals without waging a war against Moldova, which Russia can hardly afford right now,\" Seskuria added.\n\nWHY PUTIN IS WILLING TO RISK A CATASTROPHIC WAR TO DOMINATE UKRAINE\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Russia is accused of sowing chaos in Moldova. In February, Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who is unapologetically pro-European, claimed Russia was planning attacks and taking hostages in Moldova. Sandu claimed Russian agitators wanted to provoke violent clashes in Moldova not just to overthrow the government, but as part of an overall tactic to sow divisions and prevent the country from joining the European Union.\n\nRussia has also claimed that Ukraine plotted to decapitate the government of the breakaway region of Transnistria, a claim flatly rejected by the U.S. and Ukraine and is looked upon as an ongoing Russian disinformation operation to destabilize Moldova.\n\nMoldova has performed a difficult balancing act since Russia invaded Ukraine, staunchly supporting Ukraine and taking in thousands of refugees while also being cautious in its rhetoric toward Russia.\n\nMoldova is sandwiched between NATO member Romania and Ukraine and was once a part of the Soviet Union until it declared independence in 1991. Tensions with Russia continue over a tiny sliver of Moldovan territory called Transnistria, a breakaway region where pro-Russian actors rejected Moldovan independence and wanted to remain close to Russia. Moscow intervened after a war broke out in 1990 between newly independent Moldova and pro-Russian separatists in the region. Transnistria is still not recognized by the international community and is almost completely dependent on Russia.\n\nThe conflict over Transnistria was one of the first examples after the dissolution of the Soviet Union of Russia trying to destabilize and influence a former Soviet republic. About 1,500 Russian troops are stationed in the region under a peacekeeping mission that was agreed to after the war.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSince independence, Moldova has been deeply dependent on Russian energy but has tried to wean itself off Russian natural gas, joining most of Europe in its goal to diversify its energy supply after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoldova also applied for EU membership on the same day as Ukraine shortly after the invasion, a decision that would have been unlikely if not for Russia\u2019s aggression.",

        "content": "Two decades ago, the United States invaded Iraq, sending 130,000 US troops into a sovereign country to overthrow its government. Joe Biden, then chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, voted to authorize the war, a decision he came to regret.\n\nToday another large, world-shaking invasion is under way. Biden, now the US president, recently traveled to Warsaw to rally international support for Ukraine\u2019s fight to repel Russian aggression. After delivering his remarks, Biden declared: \u201cThe idea that over 100,000 forces would invade another country \u2013 since world war II, nothing like that has happened.\u201d\n\nThe president spoke these words on 22 February, within a month of the 20th anniversary of the US military\u2019s opening strike on Baghdad. The White House did not attempt to correct Biden\u2019s statement. Reporters do not appear to have asked about it. The country\u2019s leading newspapers, the New York Times and Washington Post, ran stories that quoted Biden\u2019s line. Neither of them questioned its veracity or noted its hypocrisy.\n\nDid the Iraq war even happen?\n\nWhile Washington forgets, much more of the world remembers. The flagrant illegality of bypassing the United Nations: this happened. The attempt to legitimize \u201cpre-emption\u201d (really prevention, a warrant to invade countries that have no plans to attack anyone): this mattered, including by handing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a pretext he has used. Worst of all was the destruction of the Iraqi state, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and nearly 4,600 US service members, and radiating instability and terrorism across the region.\n\nThe Iraq war wasn\u2019t the only law- or country-breaking military intervention launched by the US and its allies in recent decades. Kosovo, Afghanistan and Libya form a tragic pattern. But the Iraq war was the largest, loudest and proudest of America\u2019s violent debacles, the most unwarranted, and the least possible to ignore. Or so it would seem. Biden\u2019s statement is only the latest in a string of attempts by US leaders to forget the war and move on.\n\nBarack Obama, who came into the White House vowing to end the \u201cmindset\u201d that brought America into Iraq, decided that ending the war was good enough. \u201cNow, it\u2019s time to turn the page,\u201d he said upon ordering the withdrawal of US forces from the country in 2011. Three years later, he sent troops back to Iraq to fight the Islamic State, which had risen out of the chaos of the invasion and civil war. It fell to Donald Trump to harness public outrage over not only the war but also the refusal of elites to hold themselves accountable and make policy changes commensurate with the scale of the disaster.\n\nTempting though it is to look forward, not backward, the two are not mutually exclusive. And it might not be possible to reach a better future without understanding and appreciating why past attempts failed.\n\nUkrainians are now paying part of the price for western misdeeds. Russia\u2019s invasion was an act of blatant aggression. Moscow violated the UN charter and seeks to annex territory as part of an explicitly imperial project (in this respect unlike America\u2019s war in Iraq). Few people outside Russia have genuine enthusiasm for Putin\u2019s effort. Yet, much of the world sees the conflict as a proxy war between Russia and the west rather than a fight for sovereignty and freedom.\n\nAccording to the Economist Intelligence Unit, approximately 58% of the world\u2019s population (excluding the two direct belligerents) lives in countries that are either neutral toward the war or lean toward Russia\u2019s side. Over the past year, support for the west\u2019s position has shrunk rather than grown: a handful of countries initially critical of Russia have shifted toward neutrality. Just last month, 39 countries did not support a UN resolution demanding that Russia withdraw its forces from Ukraine. Those that took a neutral stance, including China and India, represented an estimated 62% of the population of the global south.\n\nRussia has not become the international pariah that western leaders claim it to be. Its economy has mostly weathered international sanctions, in part because the only countries willing to impose them are wealthy strategic partners of the US.\n\nIn this context, the White House should think about the message that Biden sent the world when he acted as though the war in Iraq never happened. When the US commits aggression, he implied, America\u2019s misdeeds do not count. Or perhaps, in saying that \u201csince world war II, nothing like that has happened\u201d, Biden was thinking only of Europe but neglected to say so \u2013 in which case he treated the west\u2019s history as synonymous with the world\u2019s, effacing the experience of most of humanity. Either way, Biden conveyed that support for Ukraine is mere power politics, not a principled cause in which all countries have a stake.\n\nHypocrisy alone is not the problem. Hypocrisy is all around us. What matters is whether we are working to build a better world.\n\nWhen Biden memory-holes the obvious, he is not doing so. He is perpetuating the hegemonic project that brought the US into Iraq in the first place. He sends a similar message when he routinely frames the Ukraine war as a struggle of democracy against autocracy \u2013 as though countries deserve support against an unprovoked invasion only if the nature of their government meets with Washington\u2019s approval.\n\nCountries outside the west have an interest in defending the principle that sovereignty should be respected. They have no interest in defending the principle that sovereignty is conditional. If Washington still claims the right to judge who is sovereign, then has it really renounced the right invade Iraq after all?\n\nThe US should admit past errors frankly and demonstrate, through words and deeds, that it has learned difficult lessons. No time is too late to build a better world. But even as the US takes the right side of the latest war, it is far from clear what lessons it has learned.",

Afghanistan has demonstrated to us that they don\u2019t.\"\n\nCHINA'S PRESIDENT TO VISIT RUSSIA IN APPARENT SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR PUTIN\n\n\"Putin has been fighting a war of attrition in Ukraine that is land-based primarily because Putin has realized that he cannot secure a clear military victory in Ukraine,\" she explained. \"He is playing a long game to devastate the country. The Russians have more than three times more people than Ukrainians to sacrifice in this war.\"\n\nCritics have long debated why Russia did not rely heavily on its air force during the Ukraine invasion, but Koffler noted that the strength of Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, including asymmetric use of anti-aircraft weapons such as Stinger missiles, has made it too difficult.\n\n\"Whether they fight competently or incompetently, based on U.S. standards, the war will continue because Putin\u2019s definition of victory is to keep the conflict going,\" Koffler concluded.\n\nKelly urged the U.S. to continue to support Ukraine and oppose Russia, and he accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of killing women and children and committing war crimes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We cannot allow Russia to beat Ukraine, to win this thing, because I can guarantee you, they will be looking to the next country,\" Kelly said, stressing the fact that Putin has repeatedly discussed his desire to rebuild the Soviet Union.\n\n\"For us to back off at this critical moment \u2026 to give [Putin] the space to be successful in Ukraine - that would be a colossal strategic mistake for our country.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Timothy H.J.

        "content": "On 20 March 2003, as bombs and missiles from the US-led coalition rained on Iraqi cities in the opening \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign against Saddam Hussein, the tectonic plates of the post-Second World War international order shifted permanently.\n\nFor those of us who covered the run-up to the war, the invasion and the long aftermath of an occupation marked by the country\u2019s violent sectarian fracturing, the profound consequences of that momentous day were obscured by the shock of the unfolding events.\n\nWhen US President George W Bush delivered his \u201cMission accomplished\u201d speech on 1 May, a whiff of hubris was already evident in a country racked by looting and where destabilising struggles for power were emerging. What we could not understand then was the scale of the reckoning to come. Looking back, I recall the jubilation among those who backed the invasion at how easily it had seemed to go. The naysayers had been proved wrong. Saddam and his brutal regime were gone in what was lauded as a brief and model military operation. US arms appeared pre-eminent. It was a chimera.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I returned from the frontline of another full-scale and brutal conflict: Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Without diminishing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s agency in the crimes he is committing there, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine would not have been possible without Iraq. I am not arguing that Ukraine is a direct consequence of Iraq. The moral equivalences \u2013 where they are detectable \u2013 are far more complex than Putin apologists claim in whataboutery appeals pointing to Iraq.\n\nIn different ways, China, Russia and Iran took the 2003 invasion as a reference point to push back against the west\n\nAs Patricia Lewis, head of the international security programme at Chatham House told me last week, ahead of an event on Monday tracing the two decades from Iraq to Ukraine: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a straight line. There are other paths that could have been taken. But it was a massive own goal. When Putin talks about weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine, part of it is to remind people of Iraq.\u201d Because the invasion of Iraq unquestionably created a space for a bad actor such as Putin to challenge one of the most essential elements of modern international law regarding conflict: that states should not acquire territory by conquest.\n\nHowever you judge the motives of Bush and the then British prime minister, Tony Blair, who led the charge to invade \u2013 foolish, venal, messianic or self-serving \u2013 their tearing up of the rules-based international order to launch an intervention based on misinformation established a precedent that would be exploited by Moscow and others. The long, bloody years of occupation \u2013 the suicide bombings, insurgent groups and the death squads \u2013 had their own chain of consequences. The vulnerabilities of US-led western military power, exposed in Iraq but also in Afghanistan, punctured Washington\u2019s post-cold war claim to being the sole superpower in a unipolar world. The longer \u201cIraq effect\u201d was more pernicious. It described a deepening debilitation on the international stage that was the result of both tarnished moral authority and creeping war fatigue.\n\nWhen the west was tempted again into another intervention in Libya, there were no ground forces. Later, confronted by his own red line in Syria over chemical weapons use in 2013, and with Russian warships at sea, President Barack Obama blinked. There was no meaningful response.\n\nAs Oxford professor Louise Fawcett noted recently, the invasion can be seen as a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d \u2013 a historic moment that reshapes the pre-existing order \u2013 in the same way as Eric Hobsbawm\u2019s \u201cshort 20th century\u201d was bracketed by the outbreak of the Great War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And while the invasion was sold by neoconservatives around Bush as a way to remake the Middle East as more stable and democratic, the result was often the opposite.\n\nThere is a credible argument that, in Tehran, Saddam\u2019s fall was seen as an impetus, rather than a discouragement, for nuclear enrichment, as it also lit the spark for the Islamic State insurgency and exacerbated long-festering tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNot everything can be laid at the feet of Bush and Blair: not least, the coincidence of the post-invasion period with the rise of China and rebirth of Russian imperial ambitions under Putin, as well as Iran\u2019s efforts to expand its regional influence. But, in different ways, those actors took the invasion as a reference point to push back against the west, invoking the notion of western hypocrisy as cover for their own ambitions, and to challenge what was legitimate under international law.\n\nPerhaps the biggest fallout was the one that was least visible at first. The resurgence of rightwing US isolationism under Donald Trump (who, in a 2016 candidates\u2019 debate, described the war in Iraq as a \u201cbig, fat mistake\u201d) would be tracked and analysed and gamed by the west\u2019s opponents.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know the detail and scope of those calculations, the aggressive brinkmanship that has been visible in a series of security crises in the past decade or so is highly suggestive. From the use of chemical weapons in Syria (where Russia and Iran intervened on the side of the murderous Assad regime) to Yemen, Taiwan and the South China Sea, to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic weapons programme, a new sense of impunity has coalesced into ever more obvious military alignments between several of these states.\n\nFinally, it is perhaps worth returning to the lies that led to the Iraq war. The manipulation of intelligence and disinformation occurred in a pre-social-media era and before the normalisation of political lying under Trump and Boris Johnson. But the Iraq war fabrications can be seen as a start point in a new period of widespread state-sanctioned misinformation, in which China and Russia have become the two most prominent actors.\n\nTwo decades later, we are still counting the cost.",

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was \"taking the Chinese position\" on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine when the potential Republican 2024 contender called the war a \"territorial dispute.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News Digital on Friday, the South Carolina lawmaker and military veteran was asked whether he was concerned about the current front-runners for the GOP presidential nomination \u2014 DeSantis, who is expected to announce a White House bid, and former President Donald Trump, who already has \u2014 both having a more skeptical position of the current level of U.S. aid to Ukraine than more establishment members of their party.\n\n\"Governor DeSantis, who I respect, is basically taking the Chinese position when it comes to Russia's invasion,\" Graham said.\n\n\"China calls this a territorial dispute. This is not a territorial dispute. This is an invasion of a sovereign democracy by [Vladimir Putin's] Russia, barbaric in nature.\"\n\nDESANTIS RATTLES ESTABLISHMENT GOP AFTER SAYING US INTEREST IN UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR IS NOT 'VITAL'\n\nHe added that DeSantis \"has got much to be proud of as governor,\" but said, \"I think any Republican that goes down the Biden road of trying to, you know, go weak in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is inviting more aggression.\"\n\nGraham said of Trump, who he\u2019s already endorsed for 2024, \"If he got to be president again \u2014 I really do believe Putin wouldn't have invaded on his watch \u2014 but I've told President Trump that if you don't see a nexus between China going after Taiwan, and Russia going into Ukraine, you're not watching very closely.\"\n\nDeSantis had said that \"becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia\" was not \"vital\" to U.S. interests in a response to a questionnaire by Tucker Carlson. He argued, \"The Biden administration\u2019s virtual \u2018blank check\u2019 funding of this conflict for \u2018as long as it takes,\u2019 without any defined objectives or accountability, distracts from our country\u2019s most pressing challenges.\"\n\nHe also accused President Joe Biden of having \"driven Russia into a de facto alliance with China\" and bolstering \"Putin's war machine\" with his renewable energy policies. Fox News Digital has reached out to DeSantis' office for comment.\n\nTRUMP SAYS BIGGEST THREAT TO AMERICA IS NOT RUSSIA BUT 'USA-HATING PEOPLE,' INCLUDING 'GODLESS' MARXISTS\n\nBeijing has not taken an overt public stance against Ukraine. But Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid concerns that China could begin arming Russia, has raised alarms within the global community.\n\nIn the U.S., there is a growing rift within the GOP between those who are increasingly tired of watching the federal government send billions in foreign aid, and more establishment members of the party who argue that helping Ukraine stave off Russia\u2019s illegal invasion is vital to upholding international stability.\n\nGraham, one of the loudest voices in Congress in favor of more aid to Kyiv, said it was the U.S.\u2019s duty to \"expose\" Xi and Putin ahead of their upcoming meeting.\n\nPENCE SPOTLIGHTS CHASM WITH TRUMP, DESANTIS, ON SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE, AS FORMER VP VISITS KEY PRIMARY STATE\n\n\"China is a communist dictatorship. Putin is one of the most notorious foreign criminals of the 21st century,\" Graham said. \"It\u2019s an axis of evil in its own way, when you throw Iran in there.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"But what I would do is just really put pressure on China to not help Russia militarily, because that extends to war. And I would label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism \u2014 that makes it more difficult for China to help Russia.\"\n\nGraham went a step further earlier in the interview, now pledging to \"stop business as usual\" until Russia was named a terrorist state, in light of Putin\u2019s recent war crimes charges by the International Criminal Court.\n\n\"I am going to go all in, stop business as usual on the Senate floor, to make the point that we need to label\u2026 Russia state a sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law,\" the senator said. \"It would make Putin\u2019s Russian state radioactive \u2014 more than it is today. It would put him in the category of\u2026 Iran, Syria, North Korea.\"",

        "content": "Throughout its existence, Russia has repeatedly committed acts of aggression against neighboring states and systematically supported separatism in the former Soviet republics. Pseudo-referenda have become one of the tools for weakening central governments.\n\nThe technologies used in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol in March 2014 had already been tested earlier. In the early 1990s, similar votes took place, for example, in Transnistria, South Ossetia, and the Narva region of Estonia. This was not the first time for Crimea. Back then, Ukraine and Estonia managed to keep the regions in which the Kremlin desired to \u201cprotect the Russian speakers\u201d in their constitutional field. And Moldova and Georgia were left with separatist enclaves, not controlled by the government, under de facto Russian occupation.\n\nMarch 16 marks exactly nine years since the Crimean fake referendum. It was as illegal as the previous ones, but it had a key difference. Despite the fact that the \u201cvote\u201d of the 1990s raised the issue of not only \u201cautonomy\u201d or \u201csovereignty,\u201d but also \u201cindependence\u201d and even \u201creunification with Russia\u201d of certain regions of these states, back then, the Kremlin did not dare to openly annex. The Crimean case became the first attempt in Europe in the 21st century to \u201clegalize\u201d the seizure of foreign territories under the guise of \u201cexpressing the will\u201d of the local population.\n\nThere is a certain irony in the fact that the state which crushed the signs of democracy at home, where elections had not changed anything for a long time, and the dictatorial regime had not changed for almost a decade and a half (as of 2014), seemed to get interested in the opinion of the Ukrainians.\n\nIn 1938, a similar trick was performed by the Nazis during the Anschluss of Austria. This trick, obviously, inspired Putin and his accomplices to \u201cnew achievements,\u201d the culmination of which was a full-scale invasion in 2022 and another attempt to annex Ukrainian territories.\n\nVoting at gunpoint\n\nThe vote, which took place on March 16, 2014, was part of a special operation to occupy the peninsula. At that time, the Supreme Soviet of the ARC was controlled by the Russian military. They also organized a vote of MPs for the \u201creferendum\u201d and the appointment of the leader of the marginal party \u201cRussian Unity\u201d Sergey Aksyonov as the \u201chead of government.\u201d The Ukrainian military was blocked in military units. Activists for the unity of Ukraine were beaten, kidnapped, and tortured. Crimean law enforcement officers and officials massively took the side of the Russians. The latter, in turn, were clearly in a hurry with the \u201creferendum.\u201d Its date was rescheduled twice. Initially, they prepared the residents of the peninsula to vote for the fact that \u201cthe ARC has state independence and is part of Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements\u201d (it was necessary to choose the options \u201cIn favor\u201d or \u201cAgainst\u201d). The new wording of the questions was published only on March 6\u201310 days before the \u201cvote.\u201d\n\nSource: Radio Liberty\n\nNeither of the two questions to choose from provided for the preservation of the status quo: either undisguised separatism or the return of the separatist constitution of 1992, which established confederal relations between Kyiv and Simferopol.\n\nOn March 16, the course of the pseudo-referendum was \u201cobserved\u201d only by unauthorized pro-Russian foreign freaks. None of the respected international organizations sanctified this lawlessness with the participation of its observers. But even without them, it was possible to observe the non-compliance with elementary standards. All those who wanted to vote did \u201cvote\u201d (even non-citizens of Ukraine) as many times as they liked. For themselves and for a friend. Under such conditions, there could be no question of recording the voter turnout.\n\nThe predicted positive \u201cresult of the expression of the will\u201d was overwhelmingly high: 96% for the \u201creunification\u201d of Crimea with Russia. Obviously, there was no counting.\n\nFurther events unfolded lightning-fast: already on March 17, Russia \u201crecognized the independence\u201d of Crimea and Sevastopol, and the next day, a theatrical action took place in the Kremlin with the signing of agreements on the inclusion of these Ukrainian regions in Russia, which were worthless from the perspective of international law.\n\nThe next step of the hybrid aggression against Ukraine was even more primitive pseudo-referenda in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts on May 11. Emissaries of pro-Russian rebels drove around local communities with boxes and ballots. Back then, there was no clear front line in Donbas. Somewhere, the \u201creferendum organizers\u201d were allowed, somewhere they were kicked out; they did not reach a big number of settlements in the region at all. The propagandists assured residents that the proclamation of \u201cindependence\u201d of the \u201cLPR\u201d and \u201cDPR\u201d will automatically lead to the cessation of hostilities and the return of peace to Donbas.\n\nBack then, in Donetsk Oblast, the organizers of the \u201creferendum\u201d \u201creported\u201d 89%, and in Luhansk Oblast \u2014 96% of the support for \u201cyoung republics.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin did not dare to annex the occupied areas of Donbas, despite the hope of the pro-Russian part of the local population. The region became a tool for destabilization of Ukraine, and its inhabitants \u2014 a resource for propaganda and reckless military plans of the Putin regime. Moscow prepared a similar role for the Crimeans.\n\nOnce again, it makes no sense to analyze violations of international law, national legislation, the principles of expression of will, and elementary arithmetic. Even then, it was obvious that the Kremlin was simply creating the necessary \u201cpicture.\u201d It was supposed to prove to the world that Ukraine was a failed state, unable to ensure sovereignty on its own territories. But in 2014-2015, Ukraine withstood the blow, held parliamentary, presidential, and local elections, liberated a significant part of the occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and forced Russia to de-escalate the conflict.\n\nAnd in 2022, not waiting for the \u201cfulfillment of the SMO goals\u201d or reaching the administrative borders of the occupied oblasts, the Kremlin decided to hastily \u201clegalize\u201d the loot and demonstrate some \u201cgreat victory\u201d to the Russians after the shameful escape from Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nPseudo-referenda in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts were held on September 23-27.\n\nThe idea of holding a \u201cfateful vote\u201d in the midst of a full-scale war, when a significant part of locals fled from populated areas or got killed, seemed crazy to everyone, except for Putin\u2019s clique.\n\nThe announced \u201cresults\u201d sometimes outdid those of 2014: more than 99% in the \u201cDPR,\u201d more than 98% in the \u201cLPR,\u201d Zaporizhzhia Oblast \u2014 93%, and Kherson Oblast \u2014 \u201chumble\u201d 87%.\n\nThe occupiers created the visibility of high turnout in various ways: by deploying \u201cpolling stations\u201d on the streets and near the entrances of houses and going to each flat. In all cases, an additional argument to take part in the illegal voting was the presence of a number of armed Russian servicemen.\n\nPhotos and videos taken then in the occupied cities became a vivid visualization of the very \u201cvoting at gunpoint.\u201d A significant role in the creation of the \u201cpicture\u201d was given to polling stations in Russia and in occupied Crimea, allegedly open to Ukrainian refugees.\n\nDespite the fantastic results, the Russians did not dare to outperform their Nazi predecessors, neither in 2014 nor in 2022.\n\nAs it turned out later, people in the occupied Melitopol and Horlivka \u201cvoted\u201d for themselves and for residents, for example, of Zaporizhzhia and Kramatorsk, which the Russian invaders did not reach and, accordingly, no fake referenda were held there. Because Putin\u2019s annexation, as was announced, concerns the regions within their administrative borders.\n\nRussian myths about the Crimean pseudo-referendum\n\nAn important element of the information component of the special operation to occupy the Ukrainian peninsula was the public promotion of a number of myths that were supposed to justify the Russian crime, whitewash the reputation of the Kremlin, and discredit Ukraine. The Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security reminds of the most common of them:\n\n\u25cf Ukraine discriminated against the Russian-speaking population of Crimea and restricted the use of the Russian language. In fact, the Russian-speaking population had the most opportunities to meet their own cultural needs, compared to other groups of the population of Crimea. The Russian language dominated all spheres of public life on the peninsula: it was the working language of the Supreme Soviet of the ARC and other local authorities. Almost 90% of Crimean schoolchildren were educated in Russian (7% in Ukrainian and 3% in Crimean Tatar, respectively). Almost the entire system of higher education and preschool education in Crimea was also Russian-speaking. The vast majority of local media produced content in Russian. However, the Russian occupation regime has been severely discriminating against Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars for nine years.\n\n\u25cf The referendum allowed the Crimeans to exercise their right to self-determination. In fact, the right to self-determination was exercised by the inhabitants of Crimea at the all-Ukrainian referendum of 1991, supporting the independence of Ukraine. After the \u201cgreen men\u201d seized the Verkhovna Rada of the ARC, there were no legitimate authorities on the peninsula that could announce and organize any voting. In addition, there was no legislative basis in Ukraine for holding local referenda, and, according to the Constitution, territorial issues should be resolved exclusively on an all-Ukrainian referendum.\n\n\u25cf Russia \u201cannexed\u201d Crimea bloodlessly, \u201cwithout a single shot.\u201d In fact, the Russians repeatedly used weapons and violence against Ukrainian citizens during the occupation. On March 18, the occupiers shot warrant officer Serhii Kokurin, and on April 19 \u2014 major Stanislav Karachevskyi. The first confirmed civilian casualty of the occupiers was Reshat Ametov, who was kidnapped by the militants from the \u201cself-defense of Crimea\u201d in the center of Simferopol on March 3. After 12 days, his body was found with traces of torture. Kidnappings and repressions against Crimean Tatars and citizens loyal to Ukraine became commonplace on the occupied peninsula.\n\n\u25cf Russia protected Crimea from the fate of Donbas, ensuring peace on the peninsula. In fact, the war in Donbas was a direct consequence of the occupation of the peninsula. Pro-Russian residents of the east of Ukraine were tempted by the promises of quick integration into Russia according to the \u201cCrimean scenario\u201d and allowed themselves to be dragged into another military reckless plan of the Kremlin. Crimea, like Donbas, was not threatened by anything within Ukraine, just like in all the previous years before the Russian invasion.\n\n\u25cf The Crimeans did not resist the Russian occupation and massively supported the annexation. In fact, Ukrainian citizens held street rallies and supported the military in blocked units. The most massive was the rally organized by the Mejlis on February 26 near the building of the Verkhovna Rada of the ARC. It was then that an attempt to declare the \u201cindependence\u201d of Crimea within the walls of the parliament was disrupted. The pseudo-referendum was held in conditions of armed aggression and occupation, so in no case can one trust its results.\n\nWhat did the Crimean and other pseudo-referenda lead to?\n\nJust as the Anschluss of Austria became a prologue to World War II, the attempted annexation of Crimea was the first page of the Russian-Ukrainian war that began in 2014. Having questioned the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, the Kremlin defiantly began to destroy the international security system that had been formed after World War II. An attempt to forcefully redivide the borders led to the bloodiest war in Europe since Hitler and Stalin, the destruction of cities, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, millions were forced to leave their homes.\n\nTaking credit for the protection of Crimeans from the ghostly war in 2014, eight years later, Putin brought them a real war. Today, Crimeans are dying in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. The board of the scuttled cruiser \u201cMoskva\u201d included conscripted sailors from Crimea. Residents of the peninsula are illegally mobilized into the Russian army and used as cannon fodder, same as residents of other occupied oblasts of Ukraine. Similarly, the Austrians were forced to fight with the \u201cenemies of the Reich\u201d in the ranks of the Wehrmacht. As of the beginning of March 2023, volunteers of the \u201cInformation Resistance\u201d identified 263 dead Crimeans. The full loss figures are much higher.\n\nSource: Information Resistance\n\nThe liberation of Kherson in November 2022, which Russia had already declared its own a month before, actualized the issue of restoring Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea, which had previously been de facto out of the question. Pseudo-referenda, which Russia used as a weapon, turned it into a state whose borders were no longer clear and internationally recognized. The restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine will call into question the territorial integrity of Russia. This is the main result of the reckless plan of the Putin regime in Ukraine.\n\nCenter for Strategic Communication and Information Security",

China may insist it is neutral, but it looks more Moscow-leaning than honest broker right now.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Xi said China would prioritise its ties with Russia and described the two countries as \"great neighbouring powers\".\n\nGiven events in Moscow, the optics and timing of Mr Kishida's parallel trip are remarkable. So what can we read into it?\n\nIt is rare for a Japanese leader to make an unannounced foreign trip and Mr Kishida is the first to visit a country in conflict since World War Two.\n\nThe visit was kept a secret until just before his arrival early on Tuesday, with officials citing security concerns.\n\nDuring the visit, Mr Kishida was taken to the nearby town of Bucha, where hundreds of civilians were killed last year by Russian forces.\n\nThere, he laid a wreath, saying he felt great anger over the atrocity that had taken place in the town, and offered his condolences.",

Sergei Chuzavkov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKishida\u2019s trip is the first time a Japanese prime minister has visited a country or region with ongoing fighting since World War II, NHK reported. It will also be the first visit to Ukraine by an Asian member of the G7 grouping and the first by a US ally in the region.\n\nThe dual visits by Kishida and Xi underscore deep divisions in northeast Asia toward the war in Ukraine, with Japan pledging substantial aid for Kyiv, while China remains a lone voice supporting an increasingly isolated Putin \u2013 now a global pariah and suspected war criminal.\n\nIn the face of China\u2019s growing assertiveness and global reach, Japan and the United States have moved closer in recent years, especially on regional security and intelligence cooperation.\n\nJapan is also a member of the Quad, the informal group focused on security that includes India, Australia and the United States.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Kishida\u2019s visit to Ukraine was at Zelensky\u2019s invitation, and that Kishida would return to Japan on Thursday.\n\nDuring the visit, Kishida will \u201cdirectly convey our solidarity and unwavering support for Ukraine\u201d and \u201cresolutely reject Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine,\u201d said the statement.\n\nKishida has previously spoken out forcefully against Moscow\u2019s invasion of its neighbor, warning last year that \u201cUkraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.\u201d\n\nLast month, on the eve of the invasion\u2019s one-year anniversary, Japan pledged $5.5 billion in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, quadrupling Tokyo\u2019s previous contributions.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is not just a European matter, but a challenge to the rules and principles of the entire international community,\u201d Kishida said at the time.\n\nAnd during his visit to New Delhi on Monday, Kishida announced a new plan to invest $75 billion in the Indo-Pacific, according to Reuters \u2013 widely seen as a bid to deepen ties with countries in South and Southeast Asia and to counter China\u2019s influence.\n\nXi meets \u2018dear friend\u2019 Putin\n\nThe Japanese leader\u2019s visit to Ukraine follows Xi\u2019s controversial state visit to Russia, his first since the invasion began, with the first day of talks starting on Monday.\n\nXi\u2019s visit has been framed by Beijing as a peacemaking project \u2013 despite deep skepticism in Kyiv and the West.\n\nFor the US and much of Europe, the Chinese leader\u2019s presence in Moscow is seen as a ringing endorsement for Putin at a time when his military is running out of supplies and Russia\u2019s economy is struggling under Western sanctions.\n\nThroughout the invasion, China has backed Kremlin rhetoric blaming NATO for the conflict, refused to condemn the invasion, and continued to support Moscow financially by significantly increasing purchases of Russian fuel.\n\nIndia is the only other Asian nation that has taken a similar stance, refusing to formally condemn Russia\u2019s invasion and continuing to purchase of Russian oil.\n\nModi told Putin last September that it was not the time for war, in an apparent criticism \u2013 although India has continued to maintain pivotal ties with Moscow.\n\nDuring his visit on Monday, Xi praised Putin and called him a \u201cdear friend.\u201d They discussed the Ukraine war, with further meetings scheduled on Tuesday.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Xi planned to speak with Zelensky after his trip to Moscow, citing \u201cpeople familiar with the matter.\u201d\n\nIt would be the first time the two leaders have spoken since Russia launched its invasion.\n\nUkrainian, Chinese and US officials all declined to confirm the potential virtual meeting.",

By definition it is not considered key terrain, yet by the actions of both Zelensky and Putin, it has become decisive terrain. Zelensky declared the need for victory in Bakhmut to be decisive, shortly after the release of a video in early March showing the brutal murder of Oleksandr Matsievsky. Soon thereafter, following a meeting with Generals Zaluzhnyi and Syrskyi, Zelensky ordered immediate reinforcements to defend Bakhmut, proclaiming \u201cthere is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned.\u201d\n\nZelensky then symbolically planted his own Ukrainian flag in the center of Bakhmut weeks later on Mar. 22 when he pointedly returned to Bakhmut to visit his front-line soldiers. Video, of the Ukrainian president taking selfies and handing out military awards, invoked memories of the image of a poster from World War II that read: \u201cI'm the 82nd Airborne, and this is as far as the bastards are going.\" The poster showed a dirty, scrappy, tough paratrooper, PFC Vernon Haught, of the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, marching in the dead of that cold, snowy winter on his way to reinforce the retreating American forces in Belgium. His expression left no doubt about his determination. It is the same bulldog sentiment that makes Zelensky and his military so fiercely determined to deny Putin victorying Bakhmut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe battle for the city has began in May 2022, for which Putin has invested significant human capital and national prestige attempting to capture. According to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine , since Jan 1 , Russian losses, mainly in Donbas, include 66,180 Russian soldiers killed along with the destruction of 579 tanks, 890 armored personnel carriers and 650 artillery systems. The inability to capture the city may have cost him the only winning hand he still had in Ukraine: Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group. Infighting between the mercenary group, on one side and Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Chief of the Russian General Staff General Valery Gerasimov, on the other has fractured any unity of effort that previously existed. Consequently, Putin\u2019s push into the Donbas has been significantly weakened, and as a result, is now patently vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the losses, the Russians keep coming, one human wave assault after another, with little to show for it except for thousands of soldiers returning home in body bags. While reports suggest the situation in Bakhmut is stabilizing , in Ukraine\u2019s favor, the Russians are fighting similar battles using the same antiquated WWI-like trench warfare in other Ukrainian towns: Novokalynove, Lastochkyne, Pervomaiske, Avdiivka, Nevelske, and Sieverne Tonenke.\n\nFrequently, Russian battlefield failures are followed by reprisal ballistic missile and drone attacks on civilian population centers. Despite these crushing setbacks, it does not appear Putin intends to let up. On Mar. 15, the Russian Defence Ministry announced its intent to add an additional 400,000 new recruits to its formations beginning Apr. 1. The Kremlin\u2019s strategy is to continue feeding the\n\n\u2018Ukrainian meat grinder.\u2019 Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s Press Secretary, essentially confirmed this strategy when he stated, \"the hybrid war of unfriendly countries against the Russian Federation will last for a long time.\u201d Ukraine cannot afford a prolonged war, nor can they allow time for Russian forces to regenerate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Next Step\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Mar. 28, United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Ukraine had a \"very good chance at launching a successful counteroffensive during the spring.\u201d His comments were optimistic, and they should be, after all Ukraine is in the process of receiving German Leopard 2 Main Battle Tanks (MBT), British Challenger 2 MBTs, U.S. Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, artillery systems, ammunition, fresh troops, and trained crews. All tools of the trade necessary to conduct a \u201climited\u201d combined arms counteroffensive. The U.S. and its \u201cOld NATO\u201d partners, would prefer to see that counteroffensive take place in the Donbas.\n\nBut a \u2018successful counteroffensive\u2019 in the Donbas, as Retired Army Lieutenant General and former Commander, U.S. Army Europe Ben Hodges has stated, will not win the war. It may, however, bring Russia to the negotiation table, something General Mark Milley, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated on multiple occasions as being the most likely conclusion to the war. Arming Ukraine to fight a defensive war appears to have marginally transitioned to arming them to retake the Donbas, with the same outcome, a negotiated settlement \u2013 not a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHodges correctly asserts, \"You could kill every Russian within 200 kilometers of Bakhmut and it would not change the strategic outcome, but you liberate Crimea and then I think you completely change the entire strategic context.\" He rightly continues to emphasize the \"liberation of Crimea\" as being the \"decisive\" end game for the war, concluding \u201cUkraine wins by liberating Crimea.\u201d If Russia loses Crimea, it will mean a substantial loss of influence in terms of dominance and power projection over the Black Sea region, as well as exposure of Russia\u2019s southernmost borders.\n\nTo begin that process, Hodges argues, Ukraine must make the peninsula untenable with precision deep strikes on key military facilities, headquarters, and the Kerch bridge \u2013 the military supply chain lifeline back to Russia. Simply put, setting conditions for the eventual assault on Crimea requires the precision deep strike capability of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and F16 fighter jets. Both of which, presently, Ukraine does not have because of Washington\u2019s hand wringing.\n\nFear of escalation, once again, is causing angst within the Biden Administration. Playing off those fears, the Kremlin in February declared any invasion of the peninsula to be a red line. Putin then suspended Russia\u2019s participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the U.S., and most recently announced the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. By caving into these fears, Washington is denying Kyiv the precision deep strike capability it needs to retake Crimea, thereby nudging Zelensky and his generals towards the Donbas and away from Putin\u2019s red line.\n\nThe end state in Bakhmut, as Hodges suggests, will not likely determine who will win the war, but may define who can continue to fight it. Resources committed to secure and defend the city by both countries have depleted troop strength, weapon systems and ammunition stockpiles, while exhausting front line soldiers. It will come down to who can get their \u201csecond wind\u201d fastest, then who can outmaneuver the other. As it stands now, the advantage goes to Ukraine.\n\nA Donbas First Strategy\n\nGiven the constraints imposed upon Ukraine by the U.S., it is likely that, as Reznikov stated, Ukraine will attack Russian forces from \u201cmultiple directions\u201d to keep the Russian army off balance. Kyiv, however, will likely implement a Donbas first strategy. The Donbas will be the main effort (ME) initially, with concurrent advancement towards Crimea being one supporting effort (SE), and a second SE would serve as a fixing force along the Belarus border to prevent a spoiling attack on the capital city of Kyiv. Much like the U.S. tactic of \u2018shock and awe\u2019, displayed during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Ukraine must rapidly achieve fire superiority, coupled with coordinated maneuver and speed to overwhelm a demoralized Russian army.\n\nZelensky Will Not Accept Putin\u2019s Crimean Red Line\n\nThe SE advancing towards Crimea will become the ME when the Russian army in the Donbas has been defeated and destroyed. As the SE, their task is to create the conditions necessary to assault Crimea. Without the benefit of precision deep strike capability, they will be reliant upon the U.S. supplied HIMARS \u2013 with its range of 70 kilometers, to support advancement. Aircraft supplied by Poland and Slovakia, in addition to Ukraine\u2019s current inventory of fighter jets, will be critical in providing close air support in what will likely be the most hotly contested battle of the war.\n\nAny advance into Crimea could bottleneck in the Perekop Isthmus \u2013 a narrow land bridge connecting Crimea to Ukraine mainland, then in the restricted terrain to its immediate south where extensive obstacles, tied into several bodies of water, will channelize movement, creating lucrative targets for Russian artillery. Effective targeting, counter-battery firing, extensive engineering support, and speed will be necessary to get through this kill zone quickly, then rapidly maneuver to the southern end of the peninsula to defeat and destroy the Russian defenders.\n\nUkraine\u2019s D-Day\n\nNone of this will be easy. Zelensky will have to be at his finest as an inspirational military commander-in-chief. During the Normandy invasion on June 6th, 1944, U.S. troops from the 29th Infantry Division were pinned down on Omaha beach by withering German fire. To get them moving again, U.S. Army Major General Norman Daniel \u201cDutch\u201d Cota, Sr. went forward to rally the troops, telling them, \u201cGentlemen, we are being killed on the beaches. Let\u2019s go inland and be killed.\u201d Zelensky has already had his \u201cDutch\u201d Cota moment when he returned to Bakhmut to rally the troops and many more such rallying cries will be needed in the months ahead as Ukraine expels Russia.\n\nLike the Warden in Shawshank, the tables will soon be turned on Putin and Gerasimov. For Zelensky and Ukraine, it is time to remind Putin of the Warden\u2019s fate \u2013 he killed himself as justice closed in to arrest him. For now, however, it is time for more \u201cbusy living\u201d by Zelensky and his wily fighting forces and that means taking the offensive with bold, aggressive, and violent action \u2013 the only actions Putin and his acolytes understand.\n\nCopyright 2023.

Everyone wanted to solve somehow peacefully.And at that time, armed forces were created - said the dictator, blaming Ukraine.\n\nLukashenko agreed to be Putin's puppet?\n\nFurther Lukashenko stated that Western Europe helped Ukraine because it expected an armed conflict, and even allegedly wanted \"irritation of Russia\" to end in war.According to Western media, incl.Politico, the words of the President of Belarus, clearly indicate that the politician has accepted that he must be a puppet of Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"After the Kremlin helped him repel mass street protests after the forged presidential elections in 2020, the Belarusian dictator put everything on Putin, helping Moscow to start invasion of Ukraine on a full scale in February 2022 with the territory of Belarus\" - believes Politico.",

        "content": "As Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine approaches the 16-month mark, several international organizations are investigating Russian war atrocities. This includes the impact of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion on the lives of Ukrainian children.\n\nIn April, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) met to discuss the forcible kidnapping and transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. During this session, PACE representatives stated that there was \u201cevidence that deported [Ukrainian] children had faced a process of \u2018russification\u2019 through re-education.\u201d The forcible transfer of Ukrainian children was \u201cplanned and organized in a systemic way\u201d by Russia.\n\nThese conclusions were derived in part from a report published by the Conflict Observatory, a US Department of State-funded project of the Yale University School of Public Health. The report assessed Russia\u2019s systemic program for the separation of Ukrainian children from their parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also examined the forcible deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia, the re-education process, and the subsequent adoption of Ukrainian children by Russian parents. The report deemed these processes to be in violation of international law.\n\nAt the time of publication in February 2023, the report estimated that Russia had forcibly abducted at least 6,000 Ukrainian children between the ages of four months and 17 years. In Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea, 43 identified \u201ccamps\u201d had been established to put the Ukrainian children through Russian patriotism programs. These programs sought to integrate \u201cchildren from Ukraine into the Russian government\u2019s vision of national culture, history, and society.\u201d\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nPatriotism programs include the mandatory speaking of Russian, forced recitation of disparaging statements about Ukraine and Ukrainians, requirements to sing the Russian national anthem, and praise of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian government developed a national program to offer Ukrainian children for adoption by Russian parents, even if the children were known not to be orphans.\n\nFinally, the report found that the policy of abduction, forced relocation, and re-education of Ukrainian children is being orchestrated on all levels of the Russian government.\n\nAfter examining the report findings, PACE \u201cwelcomed the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and Children Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova on war crimes.\u201d PACE will continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine.\n\nThis most recent pattern of child abduction is not the first time Moscow has implemented a child separation and re-education policy. During the 1940s, Joseph Stalin implemented a policy of mandatory re-settlement of non-Russian peoples.\n\nMilitary or police forces would forcibly enter the regions of ethnic groups, remove people from their homes, and forcibly relocate them. Residents in the Caucasus and Crimea were deported to Central Asia. Ukrainians, Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians were sent to Siberia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy was enacted to make Russia dominant, to prevent the development of dissident movements among non-Russian ethnic groups, and to be used as a tool of Russian control. Standard practice included separating children from their parents, forcing them to be educated and live in a Russian-only environment that glorified Russian history and culture.\n\nThere are alarming parallels between the brutal policies implemented by Russia during the Soviet period and what Russia is doing in Ukraine today. While numerous international organizations and human rights groups are investigating the abduction of Ukrainian children, information has been difficult to obtain from Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. For example, in late April, the Ukrainian government estimated that more than 19,000 children had been forcibly deported to Russia during the full-scale war.\n\nAccording to Mykola Kuleba of the non-governmental organization Save Ukraine, the number of children forcibly abducted during the past nine years, since Russia\u2019s original occupation of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region and Crimea in 2014, could reach 300,000. Annetta Hewko of the World Federation of Ukrainian Women\u2019s Organizations concurs.\n\n\u201cThe publication of the Yale report and subsequent discussions at the United Nations and other international bodies has brought into sharp focus this issue of recent child abductions,\u201d Hewko said. \u201cHowever, in reality, Russia has been stealing Ukraine\u2019s children for years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike PACE, the United Nations has been investigating Russia\u2019s abduction of Ukrainian children. On February 24, Daria Herasymchuk, Advisor to Ukraine\u2019s President and Commissioner for Children\u2019s Rights and Child Rehabilitation, participated in a high-profile UN event on Russia\u2019s violation of human rights in Ukraine.\n\nIn her speech, Herasymchuk called on all actors in the international community to join the rescue of Ukrainian children abducted by and taken to Russia, reminding those present that such actions are \u201cone of the components of the crime of genocide against the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\nThen, on April 30, the United Nations Security Council held an Arria-formula meeting on the \u201cabduction and deportation of children during armed conflict.\u201d In rejection of the UN norm for Arria-formula meetings, the session was not broadcasted on UNTV. Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, objected to the webcast on this topic. The Permanent Mission of the United States to the United Nations, however, streamed the session on YouTube.\n\nFew member nations openly supported Russia\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that the \u201crescue of abandoned and orphaned children\u201d was a humanitarian act. Instead, more than two dozen UN member nations condemned Russia\u2019s continuing forcible abduction of children from Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe forced transfer and deportation of children may constitute an abuse of human rights and a violation of international humanitarian law,\u201d remarked Ambassador Robert Wood, an Alternate Representative of the United States for Special Political Affairs at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these actions is devastating and long-lasting. It deprives children of their childhood, education, and healthy social development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to issue warrants for President Putin and the Russian Commissioner for Children\u2019s Rights is an important step towards justice for Ukraine and its people,\u201d added Ambassador Mitch Fifield, of the Permanent Mission of Australia to the United Nations. \u201cAustralia unequivocally condemns Russia\u2019s forced deportation of Ukrainian children,\u201d he added.\n\nBoth in 2014 and during the past year, the UN has held dozens of sessions, meetings, and breakout groups about Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, and the UN General Assembly has voted on numerous resolutions condemning Russia\u2019s aggression. In April 2022, Russia was suspended from the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is also investigating Russian atrocities being committed in Ukraine. On May 4, the OSCE published a report on Russian war crimes including the \u201cforcible transfer and/or deportation of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation.\u201d In keeping with the PACE and UN sessions, the OSCE called for Russia to immediately return children to Ukraine.\n\nThe recent sessions held by PACE, the UN, and OSCE draw attention to the irrefutable evidence of crimes committed by Russia against Ukrainian children. The ICC\u2019s March 17 decision to issue arrest warrants for President Putin and Commissioner Lvova-Belova is an important start, but more must be done.\n\nInternational pressure must be brought to bear on Russia to return hundreds of thousands of abducted children to Ukraine. Russia must be thoroughly punished for these crimes against humanity.\n\nThe views expressed are the author\u2019s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post\n\nMark Temnycky is an accredited freelance journalist covering Eastern Europe and a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.

That likely rose to over 110 million people in May 2023, with Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion and the war in Sudan being the biggest drivers of the growth, according to a report released on Wednesday by UNHCR.\n\n\u201cThese figures show us that some people are far too quick to rush to conflict, and way too slow to find solutions. The consequence is devastation, displacement, and anguish for each of the millions of people forcibly uprooted from their homes,\u201d said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees.\n\nThe total number of refugees worldwide rose by the end of 2022 by a record 35%, or 8.9 million people, to reach 34.6 million, the report said. The increase was largely due to people from Ukraine, and revised estimates of Afghans in Iran and Pakistan.\n\nIn the early days of the war in Ukraine, UNHCR said, \u201cmore than 200,000 refugees per day sought safety across borders, initially in countries neighbouring Ukraine\u201d.\n\nAt the end of 2022, \u2018\u201811.6 million Ukrainians remained displaced, including 5.9 million within their country, and 5.7 million who fled to neighbouring countries,\u2019\u2019 creating the fastest displacement crisis, and one of the largest, since the second world war.\n\n\u201cThe report is quite an indictment on the state of our world, which seems increasingly dangerous and unpredictable,\u2019\u2019 said Matthew Saltmarsh, head of UNHCR\u2019s news and media section. \u201cConflict, insecurity and rights violations have continued or ignited in many places, adding to movements.\u201d\n\nWhile the invasion of Ukraine has led to the largest forced displacement crisis in terms of magnitude and velocity in 2022, conflict and insecurity in other parts of the world have also since continued or reignited.\n\nIn April 2023, fighting erupted in Sudan between the army and RSF paramilitary forces, with devastating effects on the civilian population.\n\n\u201cThis year, the increase has been driven mainly by the situation in Sudan, where the conflict since April has produced almost half a million refugees and almost three times as many internally displaced,\u2019\u2019 said Saltmarsh.\n\nAt least 190 children have been killed in the fighting in Sudan, and the number of acutely food insecure people in the country is estimated to rise by more than 2 million in the next three to six months.\n\nThe situation also remains serious and desperate in Myanmar, where, by the end of May 2023, the number of people forcibly displaced increased by 331,600 from the end of 2022 to stand at 1.8 million, while the number of internally displaced people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo climbed to 6.2 million.\n\nUNHCR has been reporting on forced displacement for decades but has reliable data going back to the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cOverall, more effort is needed by the international community \u2013 politicians must focus on making peace as well as continuing to provide financial support to address the needs of the forcibly displaced,\u2019\u2019 said Saltmarsh. \u201cBy the end of 2022, UNHCR had received just over half the funding needed for the year; 12 of our operations were chronically underfunded but we are now responding to more emergencies than ever.\u201d",

        "content": "Despite tremendous business interest in Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction and development, a large number of western companies continue to undermine Kyiv\u2019s efforts by contributing to the Kremlin\u2019s war chest. This ongoing corporate complicity must be stopped if Ukraine\u2019s meaningful recovery is to happen any time soon.\n\nFeeling abandoned and afraid on the rooftop of their flooded house, siblings Maksym and Masha together with their crying mother were amongst thousands of Ukrainians stranded in the region of Kherson. The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam unleashed a flood of suffering and long-term environmental damage whose full consequences are yet to be realized. Miraculously, Maksym\u2019s family were detected by a military drone and eventually rescued by the Ukrainian armed forces. But stories with such a happy ending were rare in the aftermath of this man-made humanitarian disaster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM! Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\nThe latest Russian act of terror at the Nova Kakhovka dam combined with over 90 thousand recorded war crimes, clearly demonstrate that no reconstruction of Ukraine can succeed unless Russia is completely deprived of resources to wage its senseless war. We cannot have a meaningful conversation on recovery or reconstruction unless those international companies that continue to feed Russia\u2019s war chest stop doing business with and in that country.\n\nAt the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, some western businesses demonstrated swift and early exits from the tarnished Russian market, putting human values over profit. Yet the majority of western firms such as Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank, Germany\u2019 Metro AG and France\u2019s Auchan remained. According to data from the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), out of 1,361 western companies with Russian subsidiaries at the start of the full-scale invasion only 241 (17%) have completely exited. Analysis of the activities of 1,844 firms showed that they continued with \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d In 2022, these remaining companies generated $136 billion in revenue, thus helping the Kremlin to replenish its war coffers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther Topics of Interest Estonia\u2019s PM: NATO Troop Training in Ukraine Won't Trigger War With Russia Kallas said that training Ukraine\u2019s forces on their territory would not be escalatory, adding that \u201cRussia\u2019s propaganda is about being at war with NATO; they don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more staggering than the numbers involved are the excuses used by the leadership of western multinationals to justify their continued presence in Russia. The B4Ukraine Coalition, which I am a founding member of, has been engaging with these remaining businesses since the start of the full-scale invasion. The most widely cited reason for continuing with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d concerns providing so-called \u201cessential goods.\u201d Companies such as the American Mondelez International, the British conglomerate Unilever or the Swiss multinational Nestle are amongst those invoking this wholly hypocritical argument. Given the nature of their products and their increased profit margins in Russia, it is simply cynical to use such an excuse while Russia continues to terrorize people in Ukraine almost on a daily basis.\n\nIt should be crystal clear by now: all western companies that did not leave the Russian market after the annexation of Crimea and the occupation of Donbas, as well as those who have consciously decided to stay after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine are complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity. These western businesses are silent enablers of this unjust war of aggression. Any meaningful conversation about Ukraine\u2019s recovery and reconstruction should start by shedding a bright light on the issue of corporate complicity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine\u2019s true recovery can only happen when international businesses realize that this is not just a Russia-Ukraine war, but is Moscow\u2019s war against the rules-based international order, with the peace and stability that western businesses have greatly benefited from over the years, currently being undermined by the man in the Kremlin.\n\nAdditionally, any meaningful conversations on Ukraine\u2019s recovery should center around rebuilding of Ukraine's human capital, green reconstruction efforts reliant on climate resilience and the use of clean energy. In this regard, international companies can play a tremendously important role. But our actions and values need to align.\n\nUkraine right now is providing an exclusive service to the free world, countering the malign nuclear neighbor that is a threat to itself and others. Ukrainians who are sacrificing their lives want to deal with international businesses that are ready to sacrifice some parts of their profits. We do not want to deal with war profiteers, but with those who understand that there is more at stake than just income. This is what a new era of corporate social responsibility is all about. In Ukraine, your commitment to CSR is measured by your willingness to forgo part of your profit to disable the Russian war machine from continuing to kill, rape or create ecocides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flooding that resulted from the Russian terrorist attack in Ukraine\u2019s south is flushing down the reputation of those companies still doing business with Russia. Business has an important responsibility in places where it operates, especially in conflict-ridden areas. Companies can no longer afford to sit on both sides of the same fence. Either you are part of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction and recovery efforts or continue to support the destruction of its physical and human capital by feeding the Kremlin\u2019s war chest.\n\nNataliya Popovych is Founder & President of One Philosophy and Co-Founder & Member of the Steering Committee of B4Ukraine\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are the author\u2019s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.",

Those are seen to include the Ukrainian presidential administration and intelligence headquarters.\n\nRussia has issued similar threats before, but the latest comments come as Kyiv is launching a counteroffensive into south and eastern Ukraine to retake land occupied by Russia since the early days of the war.\n\nShoigu claimed without providing evidence that Ukraine was preparing a strike against Crimea using the missiles.\n\nThe Russian ultimatum comes one day after Joe Biden said that the threat of Vladimir Putin authorising a tactical nuclear strike was \u201creal\u201d, shortly after the Kremlin leader announced the first deployment of those weapons to neighbouring Belarus since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nUkraine has denounced Russian blackmail tactics, saying it intends to return control over all its lands occupied by Russia, including Crimea.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential administration, said: \u201cIt is important to understand that the presence or absence of nuclear weapons in Russia is not a variable that affects the overall equation of this war, and nuclear threats should not in any way influence the decision of Ukrainians to defend themselves or the decision of our allies to support us.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish Defence Research Agency released a report on Tuesday saying that Russia was planning for a prolonged confrontation with the west and was neither planning to end the war nor seek detente.\n\nThe risk of an escalation was also growing, the report said. \u201cAs Russia\u2019s ground forces are severely battered, the importance of nuclear weapons increases,\u201d said Maria Engqvist, an analyst for the organisation.\n\nDmitri Trenin, a prominent Russian foreign policy thinker who has grown more aggressive since the invasion, wrote on Tuesday that Russia should modernise its nuclear doctrine in order to show that the use of nuclear weapons is a \u201creal, and not just theoretical possibility\u201d.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThe possibility of using nuclear weapons during the current conflict should not be hidden.\u201d\n\nAt the weekend, Putin swiftly rejected a peace plan proposed by African leaders from seven countries that called for de-escalation and security guarantees. Volodymyr Zelenskiy had also rejected the plan, calling it unworkable. The Ukrainian president had earlier said that negotiations with the Kremlin were impossible.\n\nThe Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said that the military alliance would not strong-arm Ukraine into suing for a peace that was not \u201cjust and enduring\u201d.\n\nThe Russian foreign minister on Tuesday responded by saying the Kremlin was ready to continue its war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt means that they want to fight,\u201d he said of Stoltenberg\u2019s remarks. \u201cWell, let them fight.

        "content": "Russian forces have carried out widespread and systematic torture of civilians detained in connection with their attack on Ukraine, summarily executing more than 70 of them, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday.\n\nIt interviewed hundreds of victims and witnesses for a report detailing more than 900 cases of civilians, including children and elderly people, being arbitrarily detained in the conflict, most of them by Russia. The vast majority of those interviewed said they were tortured and in some cases subjected to sexual violence during detention by Russian forces, the head of the UN human rights office in Ukraine said.\n\nThe 36-page report came as Beth Van Schaack, the US ambassador-at-large for Global Criminal Justice, said Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, had implicated Vladimir Putin in war crimes by admitting the original invasion had not been justified by any provocative actions by Ukraine.\n\nShe added she did not think Putin would dare travel to South Africa for the Brics summit in August if he feared there was a 10% chance that an independent-minded South African judge ordered his arrest. \u201cHe is reckless with the Russian state\u2019s resources, but not with his own skin,\u201d she said. The international criminal court (ICC) has issued a warrant for Putin\u2019s arrest over his role in the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. South Africa was obliged to enforce the warrant, she said.\n\nThe UN report will be handed to the Ukrainian prosecutor general and to the ICC as it assembles evidence against individual Russians accused of war crimes during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe report covers a 15-month period from the start of the Russian invasion to May 2023. It also documents 75 cases of arbitrary detention by Ukrainian security forces, saying a significant proportion of these also amounted to enforced disappearances. It documented 864 individual cases of arbitrary detention by Russia \u2013 763 men, 94 women and seven boys \u2013 many of which also amounted to enforced disappearances.\n\nThe head of the UN human rights office in Ukraine, Matilda Bogner, said: \u201cTorture was used to force victims to confess to helping Ukrainian armed forces, compel them to cooperate with the occupying authorities or intimidate those with pro-Ukrainian views.\u201d More than half of those detained by Ukrainian forces also reported being tortured or mistreated, usually while being interrogated or immediately after arrest, said Bogner.\n\nUkraine gave UN investigators \u201cunimpeded confidential access\u201d to detainees at official detention centres, with the exception of a group of 87 Russian sailors, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Federation did not grant us such access, despite our requests,\u201d Bogner said. The UN has previously found that Russia summarily executed Ukrainian prisoners, but this is the first time it has said civilians were also executed. It documents 77 cases of civilians being executed, and the report finds others have been kept in deplorable conditions.\n\nWhile Ukraine has launched criminal investigations against Russian forces over the detention of civilians, resulting in 23 convictions, the UN rights office said it was not aware of any investigations against Ukraine\u2019s own forces for such violations.\n\nBogner said Ukrainian laws on detention for national security reasons \u201cappear to go beyond what is permissible under international law, even during a public emergency, and have facilitated arbitrary detention\u201d. She said the office had documented 75 cases of arbitrary detention by Ukrainian security forces, \u201cmostly of people suspected of conflict-related offences\u201d.\n\nVan Schaack in a briefing said tens of thousands of individual allegations of war crimes were being examined by trained investigators inside and outside Ukraine.\n\nShe said Prigozhin\u2019s remarks challenging the basis of the war last week contradicted the official Russian justification for the war. She said his remarks were likely to be taken into consideration and would probably be quite impactful in any prosecution of Putin over the crime of aggression.\n\n\u201cIt is notable he said quite openly that this war is based on false pretences and that Ukraine and Nato had no intention of attacking Russia and this is very much a war of Russia\u2019s own making,\u201d Van Schaack said.\n\nIn May the US finally came out in support of a special tribunal to try the crime of aggression, but said it should be a Ukrainian-based court with international support. Ukraine had argued for an international court established by the UN general assembly, something the US opposes on legal and political grounds.\n\nVan Schaack said Putin would be hard to prosecute so long as he remained head of state and within Russia. But \u201chis world is shrinking fast\u201d and many other world leaders who did not think they would appear in court eventually did, she added.",

This is more comprehensive than anyone thought at the beginning.\"\n\n***\n\nThe article comes from Deutsche Welle.\n\nYou can also listen to the morning conversation and green morning in the audio version on large streaming websites, e.g. here:",

        "content": "One of Vladimir Putin\u2019s mistakes when plotting his invasion of Ukraine was to underestimate European solidarity. The Russian president\u2019s territorial aggression moved the continent\u2019s centre of strategic gravity, but not in the direction he had intended. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made an emergency application for EU membership within days of the invasion. The country\u2019s candidacy was formally accepted within months.\n\nAt a summit in Kyiv last week, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was impossible to conceive of a future for the EU without Ukraine. That would not have been said before the war. Candidacy for EU membership is less important to Mr Zelenskiy\u2019s war effort than military hardware, but weapons have also flowed from European states. Military aid and institutional integration are two arms of the same embrace. That reflects a psychological adjustment in the west \u2013 a shaking off of complacency and belated recognition that Mr Putin is a tyrant who cannot be appeased.\n\nFor many Ukrainians, participation in the European project has expressed the ambition of national self-determination since the 2013 Maidan uprising, triggered by the refusal of Viktor Yanukovych, the country\u2019s pro-Moscow president at the time, to sign a trade agreement with Brussels. The EU flag is a more potent symbol of democratic aspiration in Ukraine than it is in most member states.\n\nThere is still a significant gap between the ideal of solidarity and the reality of EU accession. The bloc exists by virtue of political will, but that is expressed as a complex edifice of treaties and institutions. To meet the entry criteria, previous candidates from eastern Europe went through arduous processes of political and economic reform. They worked hard (with varying degrees of success) to shake off the corrupting legacy of communist authoritarian rule. None began the process in the middle of a war. All were smaller than Ukraine.\n\nThe EU\u2019s current structures would need reform to accommodate such a populous and economically debilitated new member. Everything from the allocation of seats in the European parliament to agricultural subsidies would have to be revised. EU membership can lead to increased regional disparities \u2013 which would need careful management in a postwar environment. Ukrainian accession would tilt the balance of influence on the European Council away from the EU\u2019s 20th-century western core towards its 21st-century joiners in the east. Some founder members suspect that process has gone far enough already. The extent of continental solidarity would be tested by a process that turned net recipients from the shared budget into net contributors.\n\nWhen speaking of Ukraine\u2019s EU membership, Ms Von der Leyen and other continental leaders are careful to match certainty about the destination with vagueness over the timetable. It isn\u2019t going to happen quickly. There is a general recognition in Brussels that Kyiv\u2019s candidacy is unique, but there is not much flex in the rules and enormous wariness of bending them (as Eurosceptic British politicians learned to their frustration when negotiating Brexit).\n\nBut Ukraine must not be fobbed off with abstractions. Kyiv can be offered treaties and a security partnership that illuminate a credible path to full membership. The EU is slow and inflexible much of the time, but in a crisis it can be remarkably innovative. Russia\u2019s aggression has been the galvanising force, giving new political impetus to continental solidarity. That energy must now be harnessed to the practical task of guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s future in the club of European democracies.",

        "content": "The pressing question of Ukraine\u2019s membership is expected to dominate this week\u2019s pivotal summit of 31 Nato states in Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital. Volodymyr Zelenskiy knows a gold-embossed official invite is unlikely to arrive while his country is still at war with Russia. But Ukraine\u2019s leader is urging US president Joe Biden and alliance leaders to take immediate \u201cconcrete steps\u201d, including security guarantees, a roadmap and timeline. Zelenskiy argues that would boost morale and send an implacable message to Vladimir Putin.\n\nZelenskiy is right. Like Finland, Ukraine\u2019s accession should be fast-tracked. Yet important though this issue is, Nato faces a far bigger question this week: whether it is doing enough to ensure Kyiv wins the war \u2013 or at least, doesn\u2019t lose.\n\nThere\u2019s a risk, if the current counteroffensive produces no breakthrough, weapons supplies run short, a new winter energy crisis strikes and western public support drops further, that Zelenskiy will be forced into negotiations \u2013 even into trading territory for peace. Secret, informal US-Russia talks are already under way. If Ukraine were already a Nato member, as promised 15 years ago, all this would not be happening.\n\nYet even now, Biden is refusing to go beyond beefed-up, long-term \u201csecurity commitments\u201d. Rishi Sunak says vaguely that Ukraine\u2019s \u201crightful place\u201d is in Nato. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, is trying to have it both ways, as usual. Germany\u2019s reliably insipid chancellor, Olaf Scholz, won\u2019t discuss Kyiv\u2019s membership until the war is over.\n\nThey claim to be acting responsibly. But this too-familiar milksoppery, which unnecessarily and unwisely restricts Nato\u2019s actions, is actually rooted in American and west European fears that Putin, provoked, might attack the west.\n\nThis is such facile thinking. Even when sober and with the wind behind it, Russia\u2019s blundering army could not beat Ukraine\u2019s 2nd XI. For all his threats, Putin fears Russia-Nato conflict, too. For him, it would be political and military suicide.\n\nThe view from Nato\u2019s east is thankfully more robust. \u201cI hear a lot [of countries] saying that we shouldn\u2019t do this or that because it provokes Putin or Russia and especially to use nuclear weapons,\u201d Kaja Kallas, Estonia\u2019s prime minister, said last week. \u201cThose threats are to intimidate us. The definition of terrorism is to make us afraid so we refrain from the decisions we would otherwise make. And this is what they [Russia] are trying to do.\u201d\n\nEast European Nato members, clubbed together as the newly-formed \u201cBucharest Nine\u201d, issued a stirring call to arms last month, insisting that beating back Russian aggression was \u201cthe only way to restore peace and the rules-based order in Europe\u201d.\n\nThe nine \u2013 Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia \u2013 all joined Nato after the 1991 Soviet collapse. They urged a \u201cnew political track that will lead to Ukraine\u2019s membership\u2026 once conditions allow\u201d. \u201cWe should not hesitate to take bolder decisions because otherwise the Putin regime will decide that the western allies are too weak (and when) pushed to the corner, they will surrender,\u201d Lithuania\u2019s president and summit host, Gitanas Nauseda, said.\n\nThe main objection to this argument was summarised by the former US Nato ambassador Ivo Daalder. \u201cThe problem confronting Nato countries is that as long as the conflict continues, bringing Ukraine into the alliance is tantamount to joining the war,\u201d he warned\n\nWest Germany gained Nato protection in 1955 even though, like Ukraine, it was in dispute over occupied territory\n\nBut there are precedents. West Germany gained Nato protection in 1955 even though, like Ukraine, it was in dispute over occupied sovereign territory \u2013 held by East Germany, a Soviet puppet. In similar fashion, Nato\u2019s defensive umbrella could reasonably be extended to cover the roughly 85% of Ukrainian territory Kyiv currently controls.\n\nThat would provide enhanced air, missile and drone defence without \u201cjoining the war\u201d. It would also allow a Nato military response if Russian forces, based in occupied territory or Black Sea waters, chose to launch additional, criminal attacks on civilians, like that which killed seven people in Lviv on Thursday.\n\nAnders Rasmussen, the former Nato secretary-general, recently raised the prospect of Poland and the Baltic states sending ground troops to help fight Russian forces on Ukrainian soil \u2013 if Nato as a whole failed to take a bolder line.\n\n\u201cI think the Poles would seriously consider going in and assemble a coalition of the willing if Ukraine doesn\u2019t get anything in Vilnius,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cThe Poles feel that for too long western Europe did not listen to their warnings against the true Russian mentality.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the start of the war, for example, France\u2019s troop presence in Nato\u2019s east has risen \u201cfrom 300 to 969\u2026 and Italy\u2019s from 350 to 385\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cNato\u2019s eastern members have undertaken historic build-ups that will see Poland soon possess more tanks than all of western Europe combined\u201d. Meanwhile, the US troop presence has risen from 5,000 to about 24,000.\n\nAvoiding splits over Ukraine\u2019s (and Sweden\u2019s) membership is important. Infinitely more important is that all Nato countries fully grasp the wider implications of a Ukrainian failure to repel Russian aggression.\n\nIf that happened, eastern and central Europe, the Nordic region and the Balkans would be destabilised. Nato would be forced on to a permanent war footing. International law would be shredded. A precedent would be set for China over Taiwan.\n\nUkraine would effectively be partitioned. And a gloating Putin and his gang, escaping justice, would be free to do it all again, there or somewhere else. So no more conditions, cavils and clever caveats, please. Nato must unleash its considerable power to ensure Ukrainian victory.",

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\n\nThe new insights derive from a survey conducted by the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) who interviewed a representative sample of 1000 Ukrainians at the start of Ukraine\u2019s summer offensive. KIIS polled people across a range of regions, age groups, genders, and income levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is fundamentally important that the happiness indicator has practically not changed both in general and among certain categories of the population.

Last week, Kerry doubled down on past comments that a key consequence of the ongoing Ukraine war stemming from Russia's invasion last year is increased global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"Lots of parts of the world are exacerbating the problem right now, but when you have bombs going off and you have damage to septic tanks or to power centers etcetera, you have an enormous release of greenhouse gas, methane, all of the family of greenhouse gasses and the result is it's adding to the problem,\" Kerry said during an interview with MSNBC on July 10.\n\nKerry added that the war in Ukraine is a fight \"we have to make,\" but that there are \"ancillary impacts as a result.\"\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO PROPERLY ASSESS JOHN KERRY'S CARBON FOOTPRINT DESPITE BIDEN ORDER: GOV WATCHDOG\n\nKerry's remarks were later widely condemned by conservatives and Republicans including presidential candidate Nikki Haley who tweeted \"you can't make this stuff up\" and \"the end of the Biden (Harris) administration can't come fast enough.\"\n\nThe comments were the latest example of Kerry warning about the climate change implications of war in Ukraine. Shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, for example, Kerry told multiple media outlets that he was concerned about emissions from a potential military conflict.\n\nJOHN KERRY SCORCHED FOR MISLEADING ON PRIVATE JET USE: 'DEMOCRATS' STANDARD OF HYPOCRISY'\n\n\"Equally, importantly you\u2019re going to lose people\u2019s focus,\" Kerry told BBC on Feb. 21, 2022. \"You\u2019re going to lose certainly big country attention because they will be diverted and I think it could have a damaging impact. Hopefully (Russian President Vladimir Putin) would realize that in the northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of a nation that was over frozen land. Now, it\u2019s thawing.\"\n\n\"I am concerned in terms of the climate efforts that a war is the last thing you need with respect to a united effort to try to deal with the climate challenge,\" Kerry told Reuters in a separate interview that same day. \"Obviously we hope that we can compartmentalize, but it\u2019s just made that much more difficult without any question.\"\n\nAnd months after the Russian invasion, in April 2022, Kerry again expressed concern about how the war may cause people to lose concentration on fighting global warming.\n\n\"What\u2019s happened in Ukraine has not helped to concentrate people on reducing [emissions],\" Kerry told The Washington Post on April 21, 2022. \"It\u2019s concentrated people on trying to find substitutes for Russian gas and to meet higher levels of production because of low supply. But it obviously does interrupt the momentum that we had created coming out of Glasgow.\"\n\nMore recently, Kerry told The New York Times in June that the war shows \"climate change is a threat multiplier.\"\n\nShortly after taking office in 2021, President Biden appointed Kerry to be the U.S. SPEC, a position that hadn't previously existed, didn't require Senate approval, and gives him a spot on the president's cabinet and National Security Council. The SPEC office is housed at the State Department and has an estimated $13.9 million annual budget with approval for 45 personnel.\n\nSince taking on the role, Kerry has traveled worldwide, attending high-profile climate summits and diplomatic engagements in an effort to push a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy alternatives.",

Ukraine will prevail and Ukraine will be rebuilt.\u201d\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar shakes hands with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky at a joint news briefing at Horodetsky House in Kyiv (Clodagh Kilcoyne/PA)\n\nMr Varadkar also revealed that an investigation is under way into an image of a drone downed in Ukraine which had a \u201cMade In Ireland\u201d stamp on it.\n\nAsked how such a part could potentially have got into Russian hands, Mr Varadkar said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe any Irish companies have evaded sanctions, but there are third parties that find ways around the sanctions, and it\u2019s really important that we crack down on that and we do take it very seriously.\u201d\n\nMr Zelensky thanked the people of Ireland for taking in tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion began.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant moral support to our nation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hosted 86,000 Ukrainian citizens, you\u2019ve provided them with accommodation, with funding, with access to education and health support, this is very important.\u201d\n\nMr Zelensky said it was a \u201cfruitful\u201d meeting where they spoke about the sanctions package against Russia, about how to stop Russia producing missiles and Ukraine\u2019s accession to the EU.\n\nWe need your consent to load this Social Media content.

He said Russia was targeting residential areas and food infrastructure, which was not only an attack on Ukraine, but on \u201cglobal stability\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that every country of the world which is striving for peace, for normal life, on all continents, it\u2019s important for them to condemn the Russian terror and participate in common efforts to overcome this aggression,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIreland is participating in such common efforts.\u201d\n\nMr Zelensky also said he was \u201cvery grateful\u201d that the Taoiseach began his visit in Kyiv\u2019s suburbs, stating that he had \u201cseen with your own eyes the consequences of the war, the consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression\u201d.\n\nAfter the engagement with the president, Mr Varadkar then met Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk.\n\nThe Taoiseach\u2019s intensive schedule of engagements began in the early morning when he disembarked from an overnight train from Poland to travel to the Kyiv Oblast region on the northern outskirts of the city.\n\nHe was taken to the small cities of Bucha and Irpin, where scores of civilians were killed during a period of Russian occupation at the start of the war.\n\nIn Bucha, Mr Varadkar visited the Church of St Andrew where a mass grave was discovered after Russian soldiers retreated from the area.\n\nInside the building he was shown an exhibition of images of the graphic scenes captured during the exhumation process.\n\nUkraine\u2019s prosecutor general Andrei Kostin accompanied the Taoiseach on the visit and explained the work done to collect evidence for war crimes investigations and secure justice for those killed.\n\nThe Taoiseach\u2019s tour also took him through the village of Horenka, where he was taken to an apartment block that was heavily damaged in a Russian aerial bombardment.\n\nThe shelling blew a huge hole in the side of the building and the interiors of the apartments that were destroyed are clearly visible.\n\nAmong the debris was a painting of an old man enjoying a bath, representing the defiance of residents.\n\nLeo Varadkar visits the Motherland monument in Kyiv (Clodagh Kilcoyne/PA)\n\nHorenka is where Irish-born cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in a Russian attack in March 2022.\n\nMr Zakrzewski, 55, who worked for Fox News, was killed alongside Ukrainian freelance journalist Oleksandra \u201cSasha\u201d Kuvshynova, 24.\n\nThe Irish premier also visited Moschun, a village that witnessed a pivotal battle in the fight to repel a full-scale invasion of Kyiv.\n\nMr Varadkar laid flowers and observed a moment\u2019s silence to commemorate the Ukrainian fighters, most from the territorial reserves, who were killed in defence of the capital.\n\nHe also visited a bridge in Irpin where Russian forces bombed civilians fleeing the conflict. The bridge was later blown up by Ukrainian troops in an effort to prevent Russian tanks from entering Kyiv.\n\nLater in the morning, Mr Varadkar visited Mikhailivska Square (St Michael\u2019s Square) in central Kyiv, where he watched as two Ukrainian soldiers laid a wreath on behalf of the Irish Government at a ceremony at the Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen for Ukraine.\n\nThe Taoiseach was then shown the remnants of several Russian tanks and other military vehicles on display in the square.\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar (right) shakes hands with actor Oleksandr Hrekov (Clodagh Kilcoyne/PA)\n\nLater in the day, Mr Varadkar met a Ukrainian actor who was assaulted in Dublin last month.\n\nOleksandr Hrekov was attacked in Dublin city centre shortly after performing at the city\u2019s Abbey Theatre.\n\nHe was part of a Kyiv theatre company that had travelled to Dublin to put on a production of Translations by Irish playwright Brian Friel. The actor required stitches in hospital.\n\nMr Varadkar visited the Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Drama Theatre company in Kyiv on his visit to the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThey performed a song for the Taoiseach before presenting him with a copy of Translations signed by the cast.\n\nThe Taoiseach then spoke to Mr Hrekov, shaking his hand and enquiring about his well-being since the assault.",

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and African leaders began in St. Petersburg on Thursday, with a far lower turnout than previous years.\n\nPutin has been seeking to strengthen ties with African countries and offered to send free grain to the continent, something the UN warned would not make up for Russia pulling out of a crucial grain deal. Russia has also been targeting Ukrainian ports.\n\nJust 17 heads of African states are attending this year, the Kremlin has confirmed, less than half of the 43 heads of state that attended the 2019 conference.\n\nIn the run-up to the event, the Kremlin fumed over the poor turnout, and accused the United States and its Western allies of putting \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d on African countries in an attempt to derail the summit.\n\nAmong those absent is Kenyan President William Ruto, whose government has been critical of Russia\u2019s recent decision to withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, describing the move as a \u201cstab in the back of global food security prices.\u201d\n\nMoscow made the decision to withdraw from the deal \u2013 which ensured the safe export of Ukrainian grain to the rest of the world \u2013 on July 17, again sparking fears over global food supplies, particularly in parts of Africa that are reliant on exports from Russia and Ukraine.\n\nMany African countries rely heavily on on Russia and Ukraine for their grain imports. Between 90-100% of the wheat Somalia and Eritrea needs comes from the two countries, UN data shows.\n\nThe shortage of grains has worsened food insecurity on the continent and shot up food prices, according to the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nSome African politicians \u2013 further than simply not attending the summit \u2013 have expressed grave concerns about Russia\u2019s war of aggression on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that this moment in time is a good time for summits in Russia. Because Russia is involved in a war, a conflict,\u201d said Raila Odinga, the Kenyan opposition leader.\n\n\u201cAfrica needs to take a very firm stance on this issue. It\u2019s a question of right and wrong. Therefore, my view is that we cannot be neutral in the place of an aggression. You must take a stand one way or another,\u201d Odinga said.\n\nDespite the food crisis, Russia has allies in Africa. During a vote by the UN last year condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Eritrea was one of only four nations globally that openly endorsed the invasion. Others were Belarus, North Korea, and Syria.\n\nBut attitudes vary. While 17 others on the continent, including South Africa voted to abstain. Eight other African nations did not put in a vote at all. A further 28 African states voted to condemn Russia\u2019s aggression towards Ukraine.\n\nLast month, an African delegation led by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led a \u201cpeace mission\u201d to Russia and Ukraine to broker peace talks between the warring nations. The peace mission did not achieve its desired goal, with the delegation unable to persuade Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to end the war - now in its second year.\n\nWagner leader appears on sidelines\n\nThe African states being represented at the St. Petersburg summit will be keen to sway Russia into rejoining the grain deal, and Putin has courted African leaders for years in a deliberate effort to broaden Moscow\u2019s global influence. At the last summit in 2019, Russia announced arms deals worth billions of dollars for the continent, along with a plan to double its trade volume with the region.\n\nRussia\u2019s Wagner mercenaries have also been deployed in some African states. A CNN investigation from 2022 showed how an elaborate Russian scheme was plundering Sudan\u2019s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against Western sanctions and to buttress Moscow\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner\u2019s founder and chief, was spotted on the sidelines of the summit on Thursday, his first sighting inside Russia since he led an armed rebellion against the country\u2019s military last month.\n\nPrigozhin was seen meeting with an African dignitary who is part of the Central African Republic delegation, according to accounts associated with the mercenary group.\n\nWagner has had a presence in the Central African Republic for several years, as previously reported by CNN.\n\nCNN was able to geolocate the photograph of Prigozhin and the dignitary to the Trezzini Palace Hotel in St. Petersburg, where, according to Russian media, the Wagner founder has kept an office. The hotel was one of the locations searched by Russian authorities on July 6, after the rebellion.\n\nSince then, Prigozhin had only been seen in public on July 19, when he seemingly appeared in a video inside Belarus, apparently greeting Wagner fighters at a base in Asipovichy.\n\nRussia\u2019s free grain pledge\n\nAt this week\u2019s summit, Putin is working against the backdrop of the Ukraine war, which has driven the country into diplomatic isolation and prompted heavy sanctions from the West. He enjoys more support from some African nations, however, some of whom are yet to condemn the invasion.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian president told the delegation of African leaders that the continent will become one of Moscow\u2019s key partners \u201cin a new multipolar world.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia is still a reliable supplier of food to Africa,\u201d Putin said, adding he would send grain free of charge to six African nations in the next few months.\n\nHe repeated his complaints about the grain deal, saying promises to Russia had not been met, and called the West \u201chypocritical\u201d, arguing it was blaming Russia for food insecurity but at the same time hampering exports through sanctions.\n\nNext month South Africa will host a BRICS economic bloc summit in Johannesburg. Putin, however, will not be present at that event and will be represented instead by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nRamaphosa\u2019s office said Putin\u2019s absence from the BRICS summit was decided \u201cby mutual agreement.\u201d In March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russian official Maria Lvova-Belova over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nSouth Africa is bound by the Rome statute, the treaty that governs the ICC, and is obligated to arrest individuals indicted by The Hague court.",

This fight has raged in Ukraine since February 2022, as Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russian forces have waged an unprovoked and unjustifiable war with shocking barbarity.\n\nTaking a sober view of history, there should be no doubt of the importance of the outcome in Ukraine and what it means not just in Kyiv, but in the United States.\n\nThere are those who today favor appeasement with respect to Russia. This is a losing strategy. We must remember that Russia is America\u2019s adversary by its choosing, not our own. For decades, we fought and won a Cold War without firing a shot.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan\u2019s \"peace through strength\" strategy crushed Soviet occupation of many Eastern European countries, including Ukraine, as well as for some of our most stalwart allies in the Baltic nations, Romania, and Poland.\n\nThrough principled and tough-minded statecraft, we convinced President Mikhail Gorbachev that diplomacy was a better path than military confrontation.\n\nToday, Putin has rejected this path. He has chosen instead to pursue the reconstitution of the Russian empire according to his own warped vision of Russian history. He has made clear that his aspirations go beyond Ukraine and that he views NATO as Russia\u2019s enemy.\n\nHis naked aggression violates the principle of territorial integrity, and rather than trying to avoid civilian targets as the West does, Putin\u2019s forces have intentionally targeted societal infrastructure and committed other atrocities against civilians.\n\nAnd under Putin\u2019s leadership, Russia is increasingly collaborating with other nations who oppose us \u2013 Iran and our most powerful adversary, Communist China.\n\nFrom both an international and domestic perspective, it is in America\u2019s vital national interest to assist Ukraine in repelling Russia\u2019s invasion. Ending the war on terms favorable to Kyiv will leave Ukraine and NATO\u2019s front in a stronger and better position to deter further Russian aggression.\n\nIt also communicates to our Asian partners facing Chinese aggression, including and especially Taiwan, that the United States \u2013 alongside its partners \u2013 retains the capacity and public will to prevent a growing axis of authoritarian countries from breaking the alliances that secure freedom and prosperity.\n\nWe should also remember that Putin\u2019s brutal war has not been without serious consequences for the American people, as it has exacerbated already-high food and energy prices here at home. Farmers \u2013 including in Kansas \u2013 are but one industry feeling the effects of this war through higher input costs, while at the same time, they are faced with meeting shortfalls in global food production.\n\nAllowing the war in Ukraine to fester will only prolong and deepen the instability already wrought, and it puts at greater risk the 100,000 U.S. servicemembers defending NATO\u2019s borders \u2013 including those from Fort Riley, Kansas. It is in our interests to help Ukraine degrade Russia\u2019s warfighting capabilities, thereby reducing this threat to our servicemembers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTo achieve success, the United States must lead, alongside its NATO allies and partners in Europe. This should not, and will not, require American troops to fight in Ukraine.\n\nThere are those who today favor appeasement with respect to Russia. This is a losing strategy. We must remember that Russia is America\u2019s adversary by its choosing, not our own. For decades, we fought and won a Cold War without firing a shot.\n\nInstead, it requires providing the Ukrainians with the weapons they need to win the war on their own. Only by doing this will Russia be forced to conclude that further efforts to compel Ukraine to surrender will fail.\n\nWe are thus supportive of the recent announcement by the U.S. on training Ukrainian forces to operate F-16 fighter jets as well as the provision of long-range missiles and other needed equipment to Ukraine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, it has taken too long to get equipment into the hands of the Ukrainians who are doing the fighting. This only makes the conflict last longer. The United States must speed up the delivery of support so that it is relevant to conditions on the battlefield.\n\nBoth Presidents Eisenhower and Reagan embraced a pragmatic approach to foreign affairs, but they were far from isolationist. Each brought the weight of American power to aid those who sought to defend themselves from oppressive forces while avoiding committing American lives to the fight. Ukraine\u2019s battle for freedom and security today is a noble one that we are right to support in the same spirit as those who came before us.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and African leaders began in St. Petersburg on Thursday, with a far lower turnout than previous years.\n\nPutin has been seeking to strengthen ties with African countries and offered to send free grain to the continent, something the UN warned would not make up for Russia pulling out of a crucial grain deal. Russia has also been targeting Ukrainian ports.\n\nJust 17 heads of African states are attending this year, the Kremlin has confirmed, less than half of the 43 heads of state that attended the 2019 conference.\n\nIn the run-up to the event, the Kremlin fumed over the poor turnout, and accused the United States and its Western allies of putting \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d on African countries in an attempt to derail the summit.\n\nAmong those absent is Kenyan President William Ruto, whose government has been critical of Russia\u2019s recent decision to withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, describing the move as a \u201cstab in the back of global food security prices.\u201d\n\nMoscow made the decision to withdraw from the deal \u2013 which ensured the safe export of Ukrainian grain to the rest of the world \u2013 on July 17, again sparking fears over global food supplies, particularly in parts of Africa that are reliant on exports from Russia and Ukraine.\n\nMany African countries rely heavily on on Russia and Ukraine for their grain imports. Between 90-100% of the wheat Somalia and Eritrea needs comes from the two countries, UN data shows.\n\nThe shortage of grains has worsened food insecurity on the continent and shot up food prices, according to the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nSome African politicians \u2013 further than simply not attending the summit \u2013 have expressed grave concerns about Russia\u2019s war of aggression on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that this moment in time is a good time for summits in Russia. Because Russia is involved in a war, a conflict,\u201d said Raila Odinga, the Kenyan opposition leader.\n\n\u201cAfrica needs to take a very firm stance on this issue. It\u2019s a question of right and wrong. Therefore, my view is that we cannot be neutral in the place of an aggression. You must take a stand one way or another,\u201d Odinga said.\n\nDespite the food crisis, Russia has allies in Africa. During a vote by the UN last year condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Eritrea was one of only four nations globally that openly endorsed the invasion. Others were Belarus, North Korea, and Syria.\n\nBut attitudes vary. While 17 others on the continent, including South Africa voted to abstain. Eight other African nations did not put in a vote at all. A further 28 African states voted to condemn Russia\u2019s aggression towards Ukraine.\n\nLast month, an African delegation led by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led a \u201cpeace mission\u201d to Russia and Ukraine to broker peace talks between the warring nations. The peace mission did not achieve its desired goal, with the delegation unable to persuade Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to end the war - now in its second year.\n\nWagner leader appears on sidelines\n\nThe African states being represented at the St. Petersburg summit will be keen to sway Russia into rejoining the grain deal, and Putin has courted African leaders for years in a deliberate effort to broaden Moscow\u2019s global influence. At the last summit in 2019, Russia announced arms deals worth billions of dollars for the continent, along with a plan to double its trade volume with the region.\n\nRussia\u2019s Wagner mercenaries have also been deployed in some African states. A CNN investigation from 2022 showed how an elaborate Russian scheme was plundering Sudan\u2019s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against Western sanctions and to buttress Moscow\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner\u2019s founder and chief, was spotted on the sidelines of the summit on Thursday, his first sighting inside Russia since he led an armed rebellion against the country\u2019s military last month.\n\nPrigozhin was seen meeting with an African dignitary who is part of the Central African Republic delegation, according to accounts associated with the mercenary group.\n\nWagner has had a presence in the Central African Republic for several years, as previously reported by CNN.\n\nCNN was able to geolocate the photograph of Prigozhin and the dignitary to the Trezzini Palace Hotel in St. Petersburg, where, according to Russian media, the Wagner founder has kept an office. The hotel was one of the locations searched by Russian authorities on July 6, after the rebellion.\n\nSince then, Prigozhin had only been seen in public on July 19, when he seemingly appeared in a video inside Belarus, apparently greeting Wagner fighters at a base in Asipovichy.\n\nRussia\u2019s free grain pledge\n\nAt this week\u2019s summit, Putin is working against the backdrop of the Ukraine war, which has driven the country into diplomatic isolation and prompted heavy sanctions from the West. He enjoys more support from some African nations, however, some of whom are yet to condemn the invasion.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian president told the delegation of African leaders that the continent will become one of Moscow\u2019s key partners \u201cin a new multipolar world.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia is still a reliable supplier of food to Africa,\u201d Putin said, adding he would send grain free of charge to six African nations in the next few months.\n\nHe repeated his complaints about the grain deal, saying promises to Russia had not been met, and called the West \u201chypocritical\u201d, arguing it was blaming Russia for food insecurity but at the same time hampering exports through sanctions.\n\nNext month South Africa will host a BRICS economic bloc summit in Johannesburg. Putin, however, will not be present at that event and will be represented instead by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nRamaphosa\u2019s office said Putin\u2019s absence from the BRICS summit was decided \u201cby mutual agreement.\u201d In March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russian official Maria Lvova-Belova over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nSouth Africa is bound by the Rome statute, the treaty that governs the ICC, and is obligated to arrest individuals indicted by The Hague court.",

Why? Why? That's what politics is,\" she said.\n\nThe Polish nation has stood firm in its support for Ukraine during the conflict, with Poles housing hundreds of thousands of refugees in their own homes and offering military support to its neighbour.\n\nRussian officials have taken part in their own commemorative events, with Vladimir Putin meeting Russia's top rabbis on the eve of the remembrance day on Thursday.\n\nThe Russian leader said he was \"pursuing a policy meaning nothing like this in the history of mankind will ever happen again\".\n\nRussia's Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar has spoken about his regret that Russia has been excluded from the commemoration, warning that \"these political games have no place on Holocaust day\".",

Then we would have to use nuclear weapons by virtue of the stipulations of the Russian Presidential Decree,\u201d said Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, in a Telegram post.\n\n\u201cThere simply wouldn\u2019t be any other solution,\u201d the former Russian president added. \u201cOur enemies should pray to our fighters that they do not allow the world to go up in nuclear flames.\u201d\n\nMedvedev, who served as president of Russia from 2008 to 2012, has struck a bellicose tone throughout Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, repeatedly raising the specter of nuclear conflict.\n\nLast April, he warned of Russian nuclear expansion should Sweden and Finland join NATO. Helsinki joined the defense alliance later that month, while Stockholm\u2019s path to NATO membership was cleared earlier this month after Turkey dropped its objections.\n\nIn September, Medvedev said strategic nuclear weapons could be used to defend territories incorporated into Russia from Ukraine.\n\nAnd in January, as NATO member states debated new weapons shipments to Ukraine, Medvedev said defeat for Russia in the war could lead to nuclear conflict.\n\n\u201cThe loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war,\u201d Medvedev wrote on Telegram in January. \u201cNuclear powers do not lose major conflicts on which their fate depends.\n\n\u201cThis should be obvious to anyone. Even to a Western politician who has retained at least some trace of intelligence.\u201d\n\nMedvedev\u2019s remarks Sunday again raise the possibility that Russia could potentially lose the war following nearly 18 months of attrition \u2013 a rare admission from a senior Russian official.\n\nThey also came just hours after Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry accused Kyiv of attacking Moscow with drones. Three drones were intercepted Sunday, but a business and shopping development in the west of the Russian capital was hit, the ministry said.\n\nNuclear rhetoric\n\nThe United States has previously warned Russia against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, both through private direct communications, as well as public channels, including at last year\u2019s UN General Assembly.\n\nLast month, Putin said Russia had moved a first batch of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, claiming they were placed there for \u201cdeterrence.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin said the rest of the tactical nuclear weapons Russia intends to move to Belarus would be transferred \u201cby the end of the summer or by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) said it had \u201cno reason to doubt\u201d Putin\u2019s claim that nuclear weapons were in Belarus.\n\nBut US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at the time that the US has \u201cnot seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture nor any indication Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said last month that in the face of aggression, he would show \u201cno hesitation\u201d in using the Russian tactical nuclear weapons stationed on Belarusian soil.\n\nBut the senior DIA officials said they do not believe Lukashenko would have any control over the arsenal. It would most likely be entirely controlled by Russia, the officials said.\n\nRussia has about 4,477 deployed and reserve nuclear warheads, including around 1,900 tactical nuclear weapons, according to the Federation of American Scientists.",

The main task of these measures is to increase the combat capability of our troops, save the lives of our soldiers, disrupt the enemy's plans, and ensure the training of reserves,\" Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi said on April 13 that the situation on the eastern front had worsened significantly in recent days.\n\nPhoto credit: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine",

Those trolls, he added, generate loads of comments, but in reality it is just several people who engage in communicating on behalf of dozens of accounts. These comments are part of Russia's big information war, the journalist said.\n\nAccording to Cernea, he must literally prove to his audience what he saw at the front with his own eyes.\n\nThere are still many in Romania who do not act directly in favor of Russia, but try to put Ukraine in the shade, trying to confuse people. We need to understand this and resist,\" said Chernea.\n\nThe Romanian journalist also noted that Ukrainian military administrations should communicate more closely with the press. \"It is important that foreigners have the opportunity to see the truth about Ukraine and be deeply aware of the developments at the front, because this also affects the situation around weapon supplies. Truth and power are on the side of Ukraine. And we must directly show who is to blame for this war, so that no one has any doubts about this,\" the Romanian journalist emphasized.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, the Second Black Sea Security Conference, hosted by Sofia, was jointly organized by Ukraine and Bulgaria. The conference is the flagship event of the Crimea Platform and the main stage for exploring solutions to security problems in the Black Sea region. Partners of the conference are Media Center Ukraine and the Crimean Human Rights Group.\n\nThe event is attended by international experts, representatives of the governments of the International Crimea Platform member states and international institutions. The participants discussed strategies for responding to regional security threats, as well as actions Ukraine should take in order to successfully repel Russian aggression in the Black Sea region.\n\nPhoto: Kyrylo Yevseyev",

From the beginning of this year, Russian forces took over 360 square kilometers,\" analysts said.\n\nThe Institute of War Research alerted that \"delaying or suspending military assistance would lead to the dramatic profits of Russia in 2024 and 2025 and ultimately to its victory.\"According to analysts, America has only two real possibilities to choose from.One of them is a quick resumption of military aid, which will translate into stabilizing the front line.However, the alternative is to allow Russia to defeat the Ukrainian army and move towards NATO borders from the Black Sea to Central Poland.\"There is no third option,\" it was emphasized.\n\nRussia will win in Ukraine?The consequences could reach Poland\n\nAccording to ISW, the possible victory of Russia in Ukraine would have destructive consequences for NATO defense.On the other hand, the success of Ukraine, even in the case of maintaining the current line of the front, would hinder the potential attack of Russia on Poland or the Baltic States.\"Russian military leaders planning the invasion of the Baltic States or an attack on Poland will have to assume that Ukraine can proceed to such a war on behalf of NATO, regardless of membership status,\" ISW analysts informed.\n\nThere is also a fear that in the event of Russia's victory, it may threaten NATO from the territory of Ukraine, due to the use of its industry and forcing citizens to fight against the alliance.\"Therefore, in this terrible scenario, NATO must expect a clash with large Russian conventional forces on its entire border from the Black Sea to the Arctic, which for the first time exposes the southern borders of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania to the risk of Russian land attack from the fall of the Soviet Union\" - experts pointed out.\n\nPoliticians also alert about the terrible situation in Ukraine.The head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Representatives Michael McCaul recently stated that \"Kharkiv is on the verge of fall.\"Russia also has plans for the lands west of Bachmut in the area of time Jar.The Ukrainian General Oleksandr Syrski announced that the Russian army is to take this area until May 9, i.e. until the day of victory, which would be a war symbol.More information on this subject can be found in the article: \"Alarming news on Ukraine.

Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and surging tensions in the Middle East over Iran\u2019s unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend have topped the agenda of the gathering.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US WILL '100%' STAY IN NATO IF ALLIANCE TREATS AMERICA 'FAIRLY'\n\nWithout more Patriot air defense missile systems to protect against Russian strikes, \"the electricity system of Ukraine will be destroyed. And no country can fight without having electricity at home, in the factories, in the front line,\" Borrell told reporters on the sidelines of the event.\n\nStoltenberg welcomed signs that the U.S. Congress might soon vote on a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, the bulk of which would go to purchasing weapons and ammunitions from U.S. defense manufacturers. And he welcomed other recent financial pledges from the Netherlands and Denmark as well as Germany's recent announced delivery of a new Patriot missile battery.\n\nBut he said more long-term and sustainable aid was necessary to better coordinate Ukraine's response over the long term.\n\n\"There is an urgent, critical need for more air defense,\" Stoltenberg said, adding that artillery rounds were also needed. \"We cannot continue to be in a situation where Russia is outgunning Ukraine, in the way they do now. The Russians are shooting and shooting, and the Ukrainians have limited resources to shoot back. So the Ukrainians need more, and that\u2019s the urgent and important message from me to all allies.\"\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani opened the first working session by calling for new sanctions against Iran for its weekend attack and concrete help for Ukraine. \"If Ukraine loses, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will never sit at the peace table,\" Tajani warned.\n\nThe Capri meeting of the top diplomats from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States dovetailed with other regional diplomatic efforts sending the same messages. On Wednesday, EU leaders meeting in Brussels vowed to ramp up sanctions on Iran to target its drone and missile deliveries to proxies in Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon.\n\nThe U.S. and Britain, meanwhile, announced Thursday they were imposing a new round of sanctions on Iran, with the U.S. targeting individuals and entities that produce engines that power drones and are involved in steel production. The latest British measures target several Iranian military organizations, individuals and entities involved in Iran\u2019s drone and ballistic missile industries.\n\nBorrell said the existing EU sanctions regime would be strengthened and expanded to punish Tehran and help prevent future attacks on Israel. At the same time, he said, Israel needed to exercise restraint.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to exaggerate but we are on the edge of a war, a regional war in the Middle East, which will be sending shockwaves to the rest of the world, and in particular to Europe,\" he warned. \"So stop it.\"\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Iran must be isolated \"because,of course, there must be a reaction to this unprecedented incident, but there must be no further escalation in the region,\" German news agency dpa reported.\n\nOn Ukraine, its Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who was invited to Capri as a guest, underlined his country\u2019s need for essential military support, including artillery, ammunition, and air defense systems as Russia pushes along the front line.\n\nHe thanked Germany for providing Ukraine with a new Patriot battery, which was announced over the weekend, but urged the U.S. Congress to quickly approve the funding package.\n\n\"So we will work here at the ministerial level to make other allies deliver air defense systems to Ukraine. Because it\u2019s of fundamental importance,\" Kuleba said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday he supported a proposal from the House speaker, Mike Johnson, to provide about $61 billion in aid for Ukraine, signaling bipartisan support for the precarious funding bill.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he hoped the U.S. funding would come through but said other allies needed to step up.\n\n\"In this moment, it is urgent that all of the friends and supporters of Ukraine maximize their efforts to provide Ukraine with what it needs to continue to effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression,\" Blinken said after meeting with Kuleba.\n\n\"If Putin is allowed to proceed with impunity, we know he won\u2019t stop at Ukraine and we can safely predict that his aggression will continue,\" Blinken said. \"Other would-be aggressors around the world will take note and unleash their own aggressions. And we will have a world of conflict, not a world of peace and security.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBorrell said Europe can't rely solely on Washington to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\n\"Concrete decisions have to be taken in order to send to Ukraine more air defense,\" he said. \"We do have Patriots, we have anti-missile systems. We have to take them from the our barracks where they are just in case, and to send to Ukraine where the war is raging. And I\u2019m sure we will be doing that, but it has to be done quickly.\"",

        "content": "Less than a week after the start of Russia\u2019s February 2022 full-scale of invasion of Ukraine peace talks began as, even then, it was clear that Putin\u2019s boast to be \u201cin Kyiv in three days\u201d wasn\u2019t going to happen. There then began several rounds of intense negotiation between Moscow, Kyiv, and several others that could have stopped the war virtually before it had begun.\n\nThe US international relations journal and think tank, Foreign Affairs, has acquired copies of the various draft versions of a peace treaty. They show how the discussions progressed and how the text of the treaties changed until eventually they reached a point where insurmountable differences stopped the process.\n\nThe negotiating processes.\n\nThe first round of talks, which lasted more than five hours, was facilitated by President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and was held in the Gomel region of Belarus on Feb. 28. Three days later they met again in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, also in Belarus. These talks resulted in an agreement to establish humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the third round of talks on March 7, in the Brest region, also in Belarus the two sides laid out their \u201cred lines\u201d for peace, at which point it was becoming obvious that there was unlikely to be a meeting of minds on the subject.\n\nAccording to the New York Times Kyiv demanded that Russians be held accountable for war crimes, its forces needed to withdraw from all occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and agree to pay financial reparations.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Who Is Andrey Belousov, Russia\u2019s New Defense Minister? Russia\u2019s defense ministry is now under the command of a career bureaucrat and economist with no military background \u2013 but for Putin, he might be the right man for the job.\n\nIn its turn Moscow insisted that Ukraine should recognize its 2014 annexation of Crimea, declare its permanent neutrality, and agree to autonomy for the ethnic Russian areas of eastern and southeastern Ukraine.\n\nDespite the lack of progress both sides agreed to continue talking and to include representatives of their presidential administrations, foreign and defense ministries in the future. Kyiv did signal that it was willing to consider Russia\u2019s demand for military neutrality if, in turn, Moscow accepted Kyiv\u2019s future membership in the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 10 Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmitry Kuleba, met on the sidelines of a diplomatic forum in Antalya, Turkey for a one-and-a-half-hour meeting chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. The main agenda item was to agree on a temporary cease-fire in Mariupol and other areas of intense fighting, to allow civilian evacuation.\n\nAgain, there was no progress primarily, according to Kuleba, because \u201cunfortunately, Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit to anything\u201d without the agreement of Putin. Russia said it was because Ukraine wanted to go back on issues agreed during the meetings in Belarus. Cavusoglu seemed to think there had been progress in his comments to Turkish media.\n\nFurther talks, held via video conferencing between March 13 and 17, seemed to offer real hope of a breakthrough. On March 15, President Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been \u201creal progress\u201d and Lavrov spoke of some hope for reaching a \u201ccompromise.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times said a 15-point draft deal had been prepared wherein Kyiv would give up its NATO ambitions in return for security guarantees outside NATO. Ukraine detected a softening of Russia\u2019s demands which Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak attributed to a reflection of how badly Putin\u2019s \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d invasion was going which left him with \u201cno chances whatsoever to move further into Ukraine territory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time of the sixth round of negotiations on March 21, the air of optimism was beginning to wane. Zelensky requested a face-to-face meeting with Putin which was rejected as it \u201cshould happen once the two sides are closer to agreeing on key issues.\u201d The resulting temporary halt to negotiations caused by this snub coincided with Ukraine\u2019s March 22 counteroffensive which by April 3 had ended the Russian threat to Kyiv.\n\nMarch 29, the seventh round of talks was held face-to-face in Istanbul during which a draft peace treaty began to take real shape. In return for permanent Ukrainian neutrality and non-nuclear status, it would receive security guarantees, described by some as \u201cNATO Article 5 Lite,\u201d underwritten by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Belarus (Russia\u2019s nomination) Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland and Turkey (Ukraine\u2019s choice).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Russia would agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, and Ukraine would reserve the right to take back the occupied Luhansk and Donetsk regions. It also clearly stated that all guarantors (including Russia), \u201cconfirm their intention to facilitate Ukraine\u2019s accession to the European Union.\u201d\n\nRussia also agreed to voluntarily reduce its military activity that threatened Kyiv to \u201ccreate the necessary conditions for further negotiations.\u201d The fact that Ukraine\u2019s week-old counteroffensive had already forced Russian forces a long way back from the capital suggested the Russian offer was hardly voluntary.\n\nPutin called the March 29 draft a \u201cnot bad result\u201d and indicated he was now prepared to meet Zelensky. The discussions ended with the expectation that the draft treaty laid down firm foundations for an end to the war and it was only the fine details that needed to be settled.\n\nAs the Ukrainians pushed Russian forces back from Kyiv revealing the atrocities committed by Moscow\u2019s troops in Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in the Kyiv region, negotiations continued.\n\nForeign Affairs quoted the then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who had been one of the mediators between Moscow and Kyiv, more than 15 drafts were prepared between March 29 and April 15, with this last version proposing to sign the final agreement by the end of the month.\n\nHow did success turn to failure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cnot-so-simple truth\u201d according to many including, significantly, Putin himself, was that Ukraine walked away from the deal because of pressure from the West and the poor performance of Russian forces led Kyiv to believe they would win the war.\n\nOthers said that the talks were just a sham with both sides merely going through the motions because that was what the international community expected. Russia\u2019s Putin-led views were too fundamental to accept anything other than victory, and each side was merely buying time to see how the war went.\n\nIt was suggested that although Ukraine said it was willing to renounce NATO membership, it did not trust the principle of third-party security guarantees because of the failure of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, by which Kyiv gave up its nuclear deterrent in return for security guarantees by among others the US and Russia, as well as the Minsk agreements which were supposed to have ended the post-2014 fighting in the Donbas.\n\nTo many it was obvious that there was no way Russia would ever voluntarily give up the annexed territories of Crimea and the Donbas. It was only the initial failure of the invasion that brought Moscow to the negotiating table while the success of Ukrainian forces not only persuaded Kyiv it could win but also gave impetus to Western allies to provide support to the \u201cwinning side.\u201d That combination also finally persuaded Kyiv that it no longer needed to make concessions \u2013 a view which further successes in the summer of 2022 only reinforced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Foreign Affairs publication quoted commentators who thought the whole basis of the negotiations was off beam. They say if the dialog had been truly meaningful it should have concentrated on conducting a cease-fire, de-escalation and protecting the civilian population. In fact, the whole basis of the discussions on both sides had been in trying to agree a post-war order when the outcome of the war was always in doubt. As the publication says: \u201cputting the cart of the post-war order before the horse of the end of the war.\u201d\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nThere has been little change in the views of either side, both seeing the only way forward being a military victory over the other. Many believe that, with the military situation becoming effectively deadlocked, the time is ripe to renew peace talks. There have been reports of \u201csecret talks\u201d between US and Russian officials and publicly voiced peace initiatives by Ukraine itself as well as China, the Vatican, Brazil, Mexico and others. The consensus is that after more than two years the war is going nowhere and, eventually, someone will lose patience and nuclear escalation will be the probable outcome.\n\nThe bottom line is surely that every war eventually ends in negotiation and compromise. The April 15 draft or something very similar seems as good a starting point as anything suggested so far. The big question is just how much is either side prepared to give and reduce its demands on the other to end this ultimately pointless war.\n\nWill Ukraine cede some of the territory it has already lost, and will Russia be prepared to give some back?\n\nWill Ukraine give up its desire for NATO membership or will Russia accept that joining the alliance is not the existential threat its public pronouncements suggest?\n\nWill both Ukraine and Russia truly believe that the external security guarantees Kyiv has signed with the G7 nations and others are worth the paper they are written on?\n\nWill peace lead to Russia re-entering the international community and the ending of economic and political sanctions or will Kyiv and others insist on some form of wide-ranging punishment including reparations for Ukraine being exacted on the Kremlin?",

The Belgian depository is being ring fenced now as \u201csystemic - with the argument going that we cannot go after Russian assets there as it might risk a run on the euro or legal action by Moscow which could risk the stability of the Belgian based depository.\n\nBoth arguments appear more like scaremongering (bollox actually - excuse my French or Flemish) and indeed if Euroclear was so systemically important then it could be indemnified against any future lawsuits by Moscow by the EU. I would argue that the defeat of Ukraine by Russia, which would send Red Army tanks West again, is a much bigger and more likely systemic risk to Europe, and the euro, if we don\u2019t secure Ukraine\u2019s war time financing with the use of immobilized Russian assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs yet the IMF\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up and I just doubt the long-term commitment by Western taxpayers to spend $100 billion a year to keep Ukraine in the war - actually we are already failing here as reflected in ammo shortages now on the front line. The only assured source of long-term financing is from immobilized Russian assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the IMF is asking private creditors - pensioners - to stump up a $14.8 billion financing contribution to Ukraine via a new debt treatment. All well and good (creditors have already halted debt service payments to August 2024 and in a worst case scenario likely will extend that service halt to run in parallel to the Paris Club service suspension to 2027 - which will get close to the $14.8 billion financing contribution anyway) but how about first/also getting Belgium to stump up the EUR6-7 billion in interest earned on immobilized Russian assets.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Scholz Urges More Ukrainian Refugees in Germany to Take Up Work Germany is the EU country that has taken in the most Ukrainian refugees, about a third of the total. However, only about 18% were employed in January 2024, one of the lowest rates in the OECD.\n\nAs yet, the EU is only talking about utilizing the interest earned on these assets from 2024. Why? It is beyond me why Belgium gets to profiteer from the war by keeping the earnings from 2022-23. And how about Euroclear contributing the profits made on its business managing Russian central bank reserves way back in time when it was already clear that Russia was a fascist state acting in a malign manner against the West. How far back?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps 2008 and the invasion of Georgia, the poisoning of Litvinenko or Skrypal, or 2014 and the annexation of Crimea, and the first Russian invasion of Donbas - does Euroclear do ESG? I wonder.\n\nThe IMF talks about burden sharing, but at the moment I only see Western taxpayers and creditors (pensioners paying) doing this so how about Russian taxpayers, Belgium, and Euroclear helping share the burden a bit?\n\nReprinted from the author\u2019s @tashecon blog!

The Soviet Union\u2019s role was limited to fighting only against Germany and only along Germany\u2019s eastern Front. Although much of the fiercest fighting and casualties were on that Front, the Germans could not risk diverting more than 20% of their military manpower from other theaters of the war.

        "content": "The value of an effective air defence system and of unwavering international support was crystal clear the night of Iran\u2019s massive attack on Israel: most Iranian missiles and drones were destroyed before they reached Israeli soil. The US, the UK and France, as well as Jordan, participated in Israel\u2019s defence.\n\nI arrived in Kyiv the following day. The contrast between the two emergencies could not be starker. Unlike Israel, Ukraine lacks sufficient air defences, and the west provides far less than it could or should to defend Ukraine against Russia. Ukraine is not dealing with one-off retaliation for striking a Russian consulate \u2013 as Israel is with Iran. Russia has been waging a war of aggression against Ukraine since 2014, aimed at eradicating its nationhood.\n\nDaily, Russian missiles and drones pummel Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure. A recent missile attack on a power generation plant in the north means that hundreds of thousands, if not a million more Ukrainians could be forced to leave their homes by next winter. Unable to occupy what is an unoccupiable country, Russia has decided it wants to make Ukrainian cities uninhabitable. Already the numbers are horrifying: before Russia\u2019s full-scale land invasion in 2022, Ukraine had a population of around 40 million. Today, just over 20 million live in free Ukraine, and that number could decline further in the months ahead.\n\nRussia is also making headway along the frontline, outmatching Ukraine in terms of artillery and manpower by a staggering 7:1 ratio, if not more. Now that the US House of Representatives has finally passed a long-awaited package of military aid worth $61bn for Ukraine after months of stalling, it could hold the line, perhaps losing some more territory in the Donetsk region. Final sign-off for the bill by Joe Biden is expected within days. In the worst case scenario, 2024 could see the fall of other major cities and towns such as Kharkiv, Sumy or Zaporizhzhia.\n\nMaking a state and a society function with a halved population, while fending off an invasion by one of the world\u2019s largest armies, requires unimaginable resilience. From what I could see over the course of a few days in the capital, Kyiv bustles with life. But it is life punctuated by almost daily air-raid sirens.\n\nAlong with a group from the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations I was on the way to the train station one day when our app alerts went off. There was no bunker for us to take refuge in, but our taxi driver shrugged, unflustered. There was no point in panicking, he said, we would reach the station soon and perhaps it would be over by then anyway. He was right; no sooner had we reached the station than Luke Skywalker\u2019s voice on our app thundered: \u201cThe air alert is over, may the Force be with you.\u201d\n\nFor Ukrainians to keep believing the Force is with them is hard enough. Doing so with one hand tied behind their back because of insufficient western support is next to impossible.\n\nIn some respects, the west is facing objective difficulty. It took Europe and the US almost two years to wake up to the fact that this would be a long war and that delivering part of their old weapon stocks would be insufficient. For two years (and more), Russia has put its economy on a war footing, while acquiring weapons from North Korea and Iran. The discrepancy in the ratios of artillery and ammunition are a reflection of this. Belatedly, the realisation of a long war has dawned on the west, and arms production is being ramped up: by next year, European governments should be able to compensate for some of the current mismatch. This is why Ukrainians perceive the coming months as their greatest window of vulnerability, perhaps greater than the first dramatic weeks after 24 February 2022.\n\nBut in other respects, European countries (and the US) have no excuses. Paradoxically, while lacking enough basic artillery and ammunition, Europe has no shortage of sophisticated air defence systems. There are approximately 100 such systems across Europe collecting dust. Important as the defence goal of deterring some future Russian aggression may be, the European continent is already at war. If European air defence systems continue lying around rather than being provided to Kyiv to save lives in Ukraine, they may end up being needed where they are currently stationed, turning the reasons against their transfer to Ukraine into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nUkraine doesn\u2019t need 100 Patriot and SAMP/T air defence systems; it just needs seven. But so far, with the exception of Germany, European countries have balked. They have come up with all sorts of reasons (or excuses), including the need to respect Nato standards. Yet many don\u2019t seem to have the same concern for breaking Nato standards on the target of 2% defence spending. If Germany can agree to send an additional Patriot battery to Ukraine despite having resisted vigorously, other European countries can follow suit. Not doing so now is simply unpardonable.\n\nIt is worth asking ourselves what explains this western reticence on Ukraine, especially given the stark contrast with the Middle East. There are two possible answers, neither of which is edifying. The first and bluntest is fear. The west has been pulling its punches in the Russia-Ukraine war because it is scared of Russia and Russian escalation. The more it has manifested its fear, the more it has galvanised Russia. Vladimir Putin smells fear, and like any fighter in a ring he is seizing the opportunity to double down. The Ukraine war has become existential for the Russian regime, and Ukraine\u2019s window of vulnerability may not last for ever. Therefore, best dig the knife in as deep as possible now that the west has immobilised itself in fear.\n\nThe second and most tragic reason is that Europe does not yet regard Ukraine as part of itself. As a colleague in Kyiv put it: \u201cEurope still considers us its \u2018good other\u2019.\u201d So long as that othering persists, Ukraine\u2019s existence will be in danger, and with it the security of the entire European continent. Showing that Ukraine is part of \u201cus\u201d means sending more of \u201cour\u201d air defences to protect Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. And it means approving Ukraine\u2019s EU accession negotiations framework and holding the first intergovernmental conference opening Ukraine\u2019s accession talks in June.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But insofar as it signals that Europeans actually treat Ukraine as part of Europe, it is existential. A diplomat stationed in Kyiv told us that when the EU moved to open accession negotiations with Ukraine last December, soldiers on the frontline were jubilant. Strange as it may seem, to them it was not an abstract idea but a tangible signal of belonging, of feeling they were not alone. And in this hour of greatest need, Ukraine needs missiles and munitions as much as a heavy injection of morale. It\u2019s hard not to return from Kyiv at the moment enriched, but with a heavy heart.\n\nNathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "content": "Great news that Speaker Johnson finally found his balls and did the right thing by putting the Ukraine support bill to the House - which duly backed it with a large majority. Notable also that included in the bill on TikTok was language that suggested that Congress supports the confiscation of the $300bn plus in immobilised Russian assets in Western jurisdiction. The House noted the fact that as Russia is the aggressor that this provides enough legal basis for confiscation. I strongly concur - let\u2019s see if the beancounters at the ECB actually manage to understand the national security imperative here.\n\nThe assumption now is the Senate votes on this this week allowing Biden to vote the Ukraine bill into law by the weekend and funds/munitions to flow by next week - long overdue - six months at least. The assumption is the U.S. has been prepositioning munitions close to theatre so that Ukrainian forces will be re-supplied in a matter of weeks now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe $61 billion was originally meant to take Ukraine thru to US elections. With the six month delay in getting this bill over the line one might think this could give Ukraine a little more time, or runway. However, given the risks still of a Trump presidency I doubt the Biden administration will risk this - disbursements on the $61 billion will surely be front loaded. That means Ukraine is going now to see a surge in military and financial support over the next six months. Doubts though still remain about long term funding beyond the U.S. election given Trump\u2019s less than certain position.\n\nAs others have argued, this funding hopefully comes just in the nick of time helping Ukraine shore up its defences which have been creaking of late as Ukraine was suffering a huge numerical disadvantage in munitions, as much as 1-10. The risk was that the Ukrainian frontline could have collapsed in places allowing Russia to take large additional swathes of Ukrainian territory. There is less chance of this now following the vote in the House. Less chance hopefully also of Ukraine being rocked by a much anticipated Russian counteroffensive north - perhaps another push to take Kyiv. Unless Putin brings forward his plans therein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine should now be able to shore up its defences and it has a chance of holding territory as is.\n\nOffensive operations likely should focus on making the continued occupation uncomfortable for Russia - rather than a large scale Ukrainian ground assault as was tried last summer. This should entail continued longer range missile strikes on Crimea, Russian naval operations in Black Sea, re-supply routes into Ukraine and attacks on infrastructure in Russia itself (oil refineries et al). The ambition here should be to make occupation so debilitating for Russia that Putin is forced to sue for peace.\n\nMuch here will depend on the munitions mix given now by the U.S. - let\u2019s hope longer range missiles are in the mix. Hopes of F16s being available at some point this year will also give Ukraine more options. And hopefully more air defences will help Ukraine protect its troops in the field and its cities and critical infrastructure - perhaps too late for much of its power generation capacity which was lost in recent weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. is sensitive about Ukrainian longer range missile attacks into Russia, particularly on energy infrastructure, given impacts on global oil prices and hence U.S. elections. These have proven highly effective in recent months and Ukraine will likely continue using arms manufactured domestically against targets in Russia. Again this has to be all about bringing the war to Russia and forcing Russia to sue for a peace acceptable to Ukraine.\n\nCrimea & the Black Sea appear to be the weak underbelly for Russia. Remember here that Putin annexed Crimea back in April 2014 for fear that post Euromaydan the peninsula would fall into NATO control - and the loss of Crimea as a strategic military asset for Ukraine. The loss of Crimea as a naval base was also seen as critical to Russian dominance in the Black Sea. And all the talk about the strategic necessity of Russia securing a land corridor to Crimea - which it took after the full scale invasion - underscores the strategic importance of Crimea to Russian military thinking. But longer range missile attacks by Ukraine have now made Crimea insecure - a huge loss to Russia compared to its position even back to before the annexation of Crimea. Having lost numerous naval assets in Crimea (likely another ship damaged over the weekend) Russia has had to deploy much of its actual Black Sea Fleet east. This represents a huge military, psychological and strategic defeat for Moscow. Further attacks on Crimea will reinforce the fact that the peninsula is no longer an asset but a huge liability to Russia - costing billions to sustain now for limited military advantage. Making Crimea and the Black Sea insecure for Russia will give Ukraine significant leverage in any future peace talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow will all this change Putin\u2019s narrative?\n\nLong wars inevitably ebb and flow. And the current Russo-Ukraine war seems no different.\n\nThis war initially saw assumptions of a speedy Russian defeat turn on Ukraine\u2019s valiant defence. We then saw successful Ukrainian counter strikes to retake territory on Kharkhiv and Kherson build optimism around a larger Ukrainian counteroffensive last summer. That failed which then saw Russia take back the initiative with gains in Bakhmut and Avdivka and elsewhere at the turn of the year.\n\nAnd much has been written in recent months of momentum in the war shifting to Russia as U.S. support withered, talk of Ukrainian military collapse and suggesting then that Russia could just wait all this out until the Trump presidency eventually threw in the towel. The line was that Ukrainian forces might collapse this year but even if they survived it was hard to see them enduring thru a Trump presidency when all U.S. support would be cut off - with Europe unable to then shoulder the additional burden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoscow seems to have believed this script - and there is much to suggest it was also not expecting the latest $61 billion to get thru Congress.\n\nHopes in Moscow of an early victory again in Ukraine have surely been dashed now, again. But the way that the House vote got over the line - Western politicians (Cameron, Duda et al) kissing the ring in Maro Lago - and then Trump\u2019s last minute suggestion that even he understood the importance of supporting Ukraine, will surely worry Moscow that Trump cannot actually be trusted to pull the plug on support for Ukraine. Moscow will now surely read the bipartisan support shown for the Ukraine bill as making it difficult to bet on a Trump presidency throwing in the towel on Ukraine. And the new $61 billion U.S. funding bill combined with Europe also appearing to finally get its act together on funding the war and its defence will surely worry Moscow that the forces being ranged now against it are appearing much more formidable.\n\nFor Moscow peace talks now might appear more logical - while it still has some advantage on the ground (if not sea), before U.S./NATO funding steps up, F16s appear, as its situation in Crimea further deteriorates and it suffers further losses in Russia itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine is still nervous over prospects of getting involved in any peace talks with Moscow as the fear is that Russia will just use any such peace to resupply for the next war. Fair points but if the West can provide enough reassurance that Ukraine\u2019s defence will remain a priority and sufficiently funded then Ukraine might just consider peace talks - the end game could be a Korean Peninsula style scenario. Many though still view the only long term solution or sustainable peace is for Russia to suffer a defeat in this war (see Timothy Synder here) - question is whether Moscow is forced to accept peace terms now whether this is a sufficient enough defeat.\n\nA question here is whether the $61 billion is a game changer in terms of Ukraine\u2019s financing outlook. It certainly helps short term - to year end 24\u2019. But again questions remain as to whether Trump will sustain US support for Ukraine. He seems to have given the nod to Johnson for the $61 billion package but given Trump\u2019s character it is hard to extrapolate that to suggest US financing is assured beyond January 2025. Given that it remains critical that the G7 signs off on the freezing and then allocation to Ukraine of the $330 billion in immobilised Russian assets in Western jurisdictions there to Ukraine. Therein the House statement was positive but still wishy washy - kind of falling back on the line that the G7 have to be in agreement for this to go ahead and deference there to the fact that most of the assets are in EU jurisdictions. Needs must though and as is, the West is still unclear how it is going to provide Ukraine\u2019s $100 billion annual financing need in war, and $50 billion plus in peace and reconstruction and recovery.\n\nReprinted from the author\u2019s @tashecon blog!

It is unclear how much this will cost, but will come from existing MoD budgets.\n\nThe package includes 60 boats with offshore raiding craft and dive boats; more than 1,600 strike and air defence missiles; more than 400 vehicles, including 160 protected mobility \u201cHusky\u201d vehicles and 162 armoured vehicles; as well as nearly 4m rounds of small arms ammunition.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines UK Free newsletter Get the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The final vote was 79 to 18.\n\nIn a call on Monday, Biden informed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that he would \u201cmove quickly\u201d to send desperately needed military aid, including air defence weaponry, after the bill\u2019s passage by the Senate.\n\nThe legislation includes $60.8bn to replenish Ukraine\u2019s war chest as it seeks to repel Russia from its territory; $26.3bn for Israel and humanitarian relief for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8.1bn for the Indo-Pacific region to bolster its defences against China.\n\nRussian missiles attacked a residential district of Kharkiv early on Wednesday, said the mayor, Ihor Terekhov. Information on casualties was being clarified, he added. Public broadcaster Suspilne said civil infrastructure had been destroyed in the assault. The air raid alert in Kharkiv region was subsequently lifted.\n\nRussian authorities have arrested Timur Ivanov, a deputy defence minister, on suspicion of taking an especially large bribe.

Ivanov, 48, is one of Russia\u2019s 12 deputy defence ministers, and is under Europe and EU sanctions over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have made significant advances in a narrow corridor in eastern Ukraine, as an offensive to take territory before a fresh injection of western military aid arrives appears to be gathering pace, Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv and Luke Harding report. Footage from Kremlin military bloggers showed a Russian tricolour flying above the shattered village of Ocheretyne, north-west of the occupied town of Avdiivka, after advancing about 5km in 10 days.\n\nFarther north, a large Russian offensive is under way to seize the town of Chasiv Yar.

In particular, analysts pointed out that Russian state media and milbloggers attempted to justify the strike by claiming that Ukrainian forces installed unspecified air defense communication and coordination equipment on the tower. They insinuated that Russian forces had tried and failed to down the Kharkiv City TV tower and other TV towers in Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts several times, including in March 2022. Russian forces notably struck a TV tower in Kyiv City on March 1, 2022, shortly after Russian forces launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin may intend to invoke the memory of the March 2022 Kyiv City strike and the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to create panic among Ukrainians during another challenging moment of the war.\n\nAnalysts also cite warnings from Ukrainian media that Russian forces are seizing on concern about a possible Russian offensive operation against Kharkiv City to sow panic and a feeling of \"impending, inevitable catastrophe\" in Ukraine.\n\n\"Kremlin mouthpieces are seizing on concerns about a future Russian offensive operation against Kharkiv City to conduct a likely coordinated information operation in an effort to create outsized panic among Ukrainians. ISW assesses that the likelihood of a successful Russian ground offensive against Kharkiv is very low if Ukraine receives renewed U.S. military aid rapidly,\" the report said.\n\nISW previously assessed that a Russian offensive operation aimed at seizing Kharkiv City would be an extremely ambitious undertaking that would pose significant challenges to Russian forces and that the Russian military command will likely have to reconsider its objectives for its forecasted summer 2024 offensive effort to account for better equipped and manned Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"The Russian military command may attempt to destroy Kharkiv City with air, missile, and drone strikes and prompt a large-scale internal displacement of Ukrainian civilians if the Russian military determines that it cannot successfully seize the city with ground operations. Continued timely U.S. and Western military assistance, particularly the provision of air defense systems and missiles, will be critical to Ukraine's defense of Kharkiv City,\" ISW analysts said.\n\nThe institute recalled a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov from April 19 that Kharkiv City \"plays an important role\" in Russian President Vladimir Putin's idea of establishing a demilitarized \"sanitary zone\" in Ukraine to supposedly protect Russian border settlements from Ukrainian strikes.",

The United States, having launched a sweeping attack on all undesirable countries simultaneously (you know this axis of \u201cevil\u201d: from Belarus to North Korea, including Russia, China, Iran and others), they realized that they made a mistake as they brought together the disobedient Russia and their main enemy China.

They realized that they could not handle this union,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko said.The president said that he is keeping tabs on these issues, since he had to discuss them with senior American officials five years ago.But the United States found a way out: they instigated a conflict in Europe, in Ukraine, and put it on the shoulders of the European Union and NATO, promising to help with money.\u201cThe goal is to distract, get Russia bogged down in the war with Ukraine, weaken it with the war and sanctions (as Russia will be too busy to build an alliance with China). And meanwhile, they wanted to deal with China, and drag others whenever possible into this showdown: AUKUS [defense alliance of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States], which is a new NATO in the Pacific, and then Japan and South Korea. This is the essence of the U.S. strategy to assert its dominance in the world. After that everything will be over: they will throw everyone under the bus, like they did in Afghanistan.\u201d",

In 2010, before the aggression, Libya's GDP was estimated at more than $75 billion. Now the country has slipped into fragmentation and a resource-based economy.\n\nIn Syria, more than 300,000 people have died in 10 years of civil war unleashed to change the political regime.\n\n\n\n\n\nIS was revived on Afghan territory. \"We know whose project it is. It spreads violence and death far beyond its camps. It is known for whose money and with whose weapons they fight,\" the Belarusian head of state said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWars for money have never made anyone stronger, the president stressed. The creditors of the wars enriched themselves either by selling weapons or by driving countries into debt, as is the case with the fraternal Ukraine today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whom did the massacre between Israel and Palestine benefit? Syria and Lebanon got dragged in the Middle East war. And look how delicately and subtly they are playing to pit Israel and Iran against each other. Practically the nuclear powers. This, of course, is far from us. But it is far away only geographically. From the point of view of Belarus' interests, including economic ones, it is very close. They are trying to take the hotbed of tension to the south in order to finally destroy the Eurasian market, cultural and friendly ties,\" the Belarusian leader said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAleksandr Lukashenko explained that this is done by the weakening hegemon: \"Global hegemony is their best asset. They don't have to do anything. They turn on a machine and print dollars. And stay rich.\"",

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nRussia on Wednesday vetoed a United Nations resolution that proposed a ban on the use of nuclear weapons in outer space amid US intelligence-backed concerns that Moscow is trying to develop a nuclear device capable of destroying satellites.\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the UN draft as a \u201cdirty spectacle\u201d and a \u201ccynical ploy\u201d prepared by the resolution\u2019s backers, the US and Japan.\n\nIn February, President Joe Biden confirmed the US has intelligence that Russia is developing a nuclear anti-satellite capability. Three sources familiar with the intelligence subsequently told CNN the weapon could destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated.\n\nBefore the vote, senior US officials claimed Russia might be hiding something should it veto the text.\n\nUS Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield echoed those claims in her speech after the vote on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAnd so today\u2019s veto begs the question: Why? Why, if you are following the rules, would you not support a resolution that reaffirms them?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhat could you possibly be hiding? It\u2019s baffling. And it\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nThe US ambassador also condemned China\u2019s abstention, saying Beijing \u201chas shown that it would rather defend Russia as its junior partner, than safeguard the global nonproliferation regime.\u201d\n\nThe Council voted against resolution amendments tabled by Russia and China.\n\nThomas-Greenfield said Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cmarks a real missed opportunity to rebuild much-needed trust in existing arms control obligations.\u201d\n\nA US and Japan-drafted resolution had received cross-regional support from more than 60 member states.\n\nIt intended to strengthen and uphold the global non-proliferation regime, including in outer space, and reaffirm the shared goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes.\n\nIt also called on UN member states not to develop nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction designed to be placed in Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nNuclear threat\n\nThe potential threat of nuclear weapons in space has been amplified by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has triggered Europe\u2019s most significant land conflict since World War II and sent relations between the US and Russia \u2013 the world\u2019s two largest nuclear armed states \u2013 to new lows.\n\nThe White House\u2019s comments on the prospect of a Russian nuclear space weapon have deepened those concerns.\n\nExperts say this kind of weapon could have the potential to wipe out mega constellations of small satellites, like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which has been successfully used by Ukraine to counter Russian troops.\n\nThis would almost certainly be \u201ca last-ditch weapon\u201d for Russia, the US official and other sources said \u2014 because it would do the same damage to whatever Russian satellites were also in the area.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said in March that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons if there is a threat to the existence of the Russian state but \u201cthere has never been such a need.\u201d\n\nHe also told officials that space projects, including the setup of a nuclear power unit in space, should be a priority and receive proper financing.\n\nLast year, Putin deployed tactical nuclear weapons to neighboring ally Belarus, and former Russian president and deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said strategic nuclear weapons could be used to defend territories incorporated into Russia from Ukraine.",

In Moldova, wedged between an embattled Ukraine and Romania, Russia\u2019s interference is only increasing. And without more Western help, its foreign minister told me this week, this small European country could fall under Moscow\u2019s control.\n\nMihai Popsoi, Moldova\u2019s 37-year-old newly minted top diplomat, was in Washington to remind Biden administration officials and lawmakers that the war in Ukraine is not just about Ukraine. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor two years ago, the 3 million residents of Moldova have faced unprecedented instability and anxiety. Putin is threatening Moldova\u2019s security, squeezing its economy and undermining its democracy, efforts that are all aimed at replacing its pro-Western leadership with a new government bought and paid for by the Kremlin.\n\nKamyanets-Podilskyi Uman UKRAINE Briceni Soroca TRANSNISTRIA Self-proclaimed republic since 1991 Botosani Balti Ribnita Dnister River MOLDOVA Dubasari Iasi Chisinau Tiraspol Bender Vaslui Bacau ROMANIA Odessa Comrat UKRAINE Mouth of Dnister River Cahul Focsani Bolhrad Galati Black Sea Izmayil Braila Buzau Tulcea Danube River Danube Delta 25 MILES Kamyanets-Podilskyi Uman UKRAINE Briceni Soroca TRANSNISTRIA Balti Ribnita Self-proclaimed republic since 1991 MOLDOVA Dubasari Iasi Chisinau Tiraspol ROMANIA Bender Bacau Odessa Comrat Dnister R.

Comrat UKRAINE Black Sea Galati Danube River Danube Delta 50 MILES\n\nWhile Moldova, under European Union-aligned President Maia Sandu, struggles to fight off Russian meddling and build ties with the West, it knows that its survival as a democracy is contingent on Ukraine\u2019s survival, the foreign minister told me. The only thing standing between Moldova (which has fewer than 10,000 personnel in its armed forces) and a Russian attack is the Ukrainian army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue of whether Russia wants to invade, it\u2019s only an issue of if they can,\u201d Popsoi said. \u201cGod forbid, if the Russians would feel emboldened, clearly Moldova would be next. And after that, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nFor now, Russia is waging hybrid warfare in Moldova, whereby the Kremlin is using all available means of leverage and interference to impose its will \u2014 short of bombing the country. Moscow has tried to orchestrate a coup, trained fake anti-government protesters, flooded the country with disinformation and funneled illicit cash to pro-Russian opposition parties.\n\nJust last weekend, Moscow hosted a conference for pro-Russian Moldovan opposition leaders, who announced a new election bloc ahead of Moldova\u2019s October presidential elections. The main pro-Russian party is led by Israeli-born Moldovan billionaire Ilan Shor, who was convicted in 2017 of stealing $1 billion from banks in his country. In 2022, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Shor for working with \u201ccorrupt oligarchs and Moscow-based entities to create political unrest in Moldova\u201d and undermine Moldova\u2019s moves to join the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoldovans will also vote in October on whether to amend the country\u2019s constitution to enshrine its E.U. membership aspirations. This is what angers Putin most of all, Popsoi said. It\u2019s not lost on Moldovans that Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine was sparked by Kyiv\u2019s turn toward the E.U., and that Putin tries to justify his 2022 invasion by pointing to Ukraine\u2019s aspirations to join NATO.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are using our democratic process against us,\u201d Popsoi said. \u201cThey are trying to install a pro-Russian authoritarian regime that would mimic the Russian model of government, to stab Ukraine in the back.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Josh Rogin 's opinions Follow\n\nThe internationally recognized territory of Moldova includes two regions already with greater loyalty to Moscow. Russia has about 1,500 \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d troops in the autonomous region of Transnistria, a strip of land along Ukraine\u2019s western border, that it could activate as troublemakers at any time. And last year, Moscow scored a success in its political incursions into Moldova when its heavily supported candidate for governor of the autonomous region of Gagauzia won, despite being virtually unknown before her candidacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the Western-leaning Moldovan government has been moving to reduce dependence on Russian energy and to thwart Russian interference, with significant U.S. help. Largely because of U.S. and European investment, Moldova cut its dependence on Russian gas and is now buying U.S.-supplied liquefied natural gas (at lower prices, by the way) through a new cooperative project with Greece.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more the United States and its partners can and should do. President Biden should show solidarity by inviting Sandu to the White House. Moldova needs more foreign investment in its infrastructure so it can become a hub for the future reconstruction of Ukraine. It also needs help dealing with Russia\u2019s advances in technology, such as deepfakes and other tools powered by artificial intelligence, which are amplifying the Kremlin\u2019s disinformation campaigns.\n\n\u201cMoldova is a petri dish for Russian hybrid warfare,\u201d Popsoi said. \u201cAnd the tactics that we see being used in Moldova, if the Russians feel they are effective here, they are going to take them on the road.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a popular narrative in parts of the Republican Party that holds that Ukraine can\u2019t win its war with Russia, and that U.S. aid is only prolonging the conflict. This view, as espoused by Sen. J.D. Vance (Ohio) and others, ignores the impact Ukraine\u2019s defeat would have for its neighbors, the rest of the region \u2014 and the United States.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s ambitions are imperial; he doesn\u2019t deny them. He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union,\u201d the foreign minister said. If Russia isn\u2019t stopped in Ukraine, \u201cthen all democracies are in trouble.\u201d",

The US agreed to send 31 Abrams to Ukraine in January 2023. Five have been lost to Russian attacks. The proliferation of drones means \u201cthere isn\u2019t open ground that you can just drive across without fear of detection\u201d, a senior defence official said on Thursday. \u201cNow, there is a way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with our Ukrainian partners, and other partners on the ground, to help them think through how they might use that, in that kind of changed environment now, where everything is seen immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians have not adopted tactics that could have made the tanks more effective, one of the US defence officials said, such as in combined-arms warfare, training for which was provided by the US in Germany. Russian forces have sustained heavy losses of their own tanks and armoured equipment due to highly effective surveillance and attacks by Ukrainian drone warfare units.\n\nThe US does not expect Ukraine to launch large-scale offensive operations against Russian forces in the near term, a US defence official said. The goal was to help Ukraine\u2019s forces \u201cregain the initiative \u2026 In terms of what we see in the next several months of operations, Ukrainians will need to rebuild quite a bit to take on board all of these new supplies after having rationed ammunition and other supplies \u2026 and ensure that they can defend their positions\u201d.\n\nIntense artillery, rocket and drone attacks either side of the Russia-Ukraine frontline left at least 10 people dead and more than a dozen wounded, regional officials said. Russian attacks killed at least six in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian officials said. Four people were killed in Russian-occupied parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, according to Moscow-installed authorities.\n\nChina must stop supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine if it wants to enjoy good relations with the west, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in Berlin on Thursday. \u201cLast year, Russia imported 90% of its microelectronics from China, used to produce missiles, tanks and aircraft. China is also working to provide Russia with improved satellite capabilities and imaging,\u201d he said. \u201cChina says it wants good relations with the west \u2026 They cannot have it both ways.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg cautioned western allies: \u201cIn the past, we made the mistake of becoming dependent on Russian oil and gas. We must not repeat that mistake with China. Depending on its money, its raw materials, its technologies \u2013 dependencies make us vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Macron has warned that Europe faces an existential threat from Russian aggression and must adopt a \u201ccredible\u201d defence strategy less dependent on the US. The French president described Russia\u2019s behaviour after its invasion of Ukraine as \u201cuninhibited\u201d and said it was no longer clear where Moscow\u2019s \u201climits\u201d lay. In his almost two-hour-long speech, Macron warned that \u201cour Europe, today, is mortal and it can die\u201d, Jennifer Rankin writes from Brussels.\n\nPoland and Lithuania have said they are prepared to help Ukrainian authorities return men subject to military conscription, after Ukraine\u2019s government announced this week that it was suspending consular services and the issue of passports for such men who are living abroad, Shaun Walker writes from Warsaw. \u201cWe have suggested for a long time that we can help the Ukrainian side ensure that people subject to [compulsory] military service go to Ukraine,\u201d W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland\u2019s defence minister, told the television channel Polsat. His Lithuanian counterpart, Laurynas Kas\u010di\u016bnas, said his country may make similar efforts. \u201cUkraine is very short of mobilisation reserve \u2026 This is not fair to those citizens who are fighting for their country.\u201d\n\nThe Polish parliament is due to consider new regulations next week that would require all Ukrainians to show a valid passport to be able to access benefits in Poland. Previously, Ukrainian refugees had been able to do so by showing any other documents proving their identity. Kosiniak-Kamysz, the defence minister, said: \u201cI think many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine.\u201d Tadeusz Ko\u0142odziej, a Polish NGO lawyer, said: \u201cThe draft text we have seen would cut around 80% of benefits for people without passports \u2026 If it will be impossible to get a passport, many of these people may ask for asylum.\u201d",

China\n\nThe report specifically mentioned four countries \u2014 China, Russia, Iran and North Korea \u2014 but none of them pose a greater threat than China, according to the report.\n\n\"China has the capability to directly compete with the U.S. and U.S. allies and to alter the rules-based global order in ways that support Beijing\u2019s power and form of governance over that of the U.S.,\" the report says.\n\nThere's concern that the People's Republic of China (PRC) will attempt to influence the 2024 U.S. elections \"at some level \u2026 to sideline critics of China and magnify U.S. society divisions.\"\n\nCHINA SPENDING \u2018DRASTICALLY MORE\u2019 ON MILITARY THAN DECLARED, US ADMIRAL SAYS\n\n\"PRC actors have increased their capabilities to conduct covert influence operations and disseminate disinformation,\" the spy report says. \"Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing\u2019s goals.\"\n\nPresident Xi Jinping still sees Taiwan as rightfully part of the People's Republic of China.

Despite initial objections from former President Donald Trump and some Republicans in Congress, the aid package was approved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to US aid, the European Union is providing assistance, including a Czech-led initiative that will begin supplying Ukraine with some 300,000 rounds of 155mm artillery shells in June. Germany also announced plans in April to supply a US-made Patriot air defense system and air defense missiles.",

Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe $95 billion military aid package President Joe Biden signed Wednesday was a feat of tough-minded negotiation to get funding to Ukraine and Israel after months of congressional horse-trading. But if the aid inflates those countries\u2019 war aims, it could discourage the kind of tough-minded negotiation that is the only way to end their wars.\n\nMark Hannah Courtesy of Mark Hannah\n\nBiden is right to help democratic countries confront their illiberal enemies. Israel and Ukraine suffered terrible crimes of aggression. But lofty expressions of unconditional support can paradoxically hurt the countries they are meant to help by hindering the kind of negotiated peace that saves civilian lives and restores stability.\n\nThe funds might motivate Ukraine and Israel to pursue unwinnable victories: the full restoration of Ukraine\u2019s borders and reclamation of Crimea, and the destruction of Hamas, respectively. In international politics and armed conflict, fraught as they are with mutual distrust and competing views of fairness, sometimes countries can\u2019t achieve justice \u2014 they can only achieve peace.\n\nThe new infusion of aid gives the US a lot of leverage with Ukraine and Israel. Washington has largely refused to exercise its leverage thus far, but it must do so now or peace in the near future doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to maintain that \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas is the only outcome he will accept. But as the war grinds on, Israel reports having killed fewer than half of Hamas\u2019 fighters while its tunnel network hasn\u2019t been completely dismantled, indicating the group can likely sustain an insurgency against Israel for the foreseeable future. And even if it were possible to destroy Hamas, that outcome could prove to be a catastrophic success when images of the accompanying civilian devastation fuel ever more radicalization among Palestinians and stirs angry Arab publics who pressure their leaders to scuttle Arab-Israeli normalization efforts.\n\nSimilarly, the Ukrainian government insists it will continue fighting until it regains all of the territory it has lost, including Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and there is no sign the US administration is pushing it to reconsider. But as Gen. Mark Milley, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me a year ago, \u201cneither side is likely to achieve their complete political objectives through military means\u201d so \u201cit will probably end somewhere, somehow at a negotiating table.\u201d And that was before Ukraine lost some of its best troops and equipment in last summer\u2019s highly anticipated offensive, which failed to strike a knockout blow to Russia.\n\nTo its credit, the administration seems clear-eyed enough to privately acknowledge Ukraine\u2019s chances for retaking additional territory are slim. But there is still no public indication the US is trying to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement. Signaling American resolve can preserve Ukraine\u2019s bargaining position, but it risks convincing Ukraine to reject a reasonable peace deal \u2014 if one is eventually offered \u2014 and continue fighting in pursuit of morally righteous but unattainable goals.\n\nLikewise, while the administration has ramped up humanitarian aid to Gaza, encouraged negotiations to get Hamas to release Israeli hostages and called for the Palestinian Authority to administer Gaza, it could do more to convince Israel to fundamentally rethink its destabilizing goals. The Biden administration should publicly and privately convey to Israel\u2019s leaders that their current strategy is unlikely to succeed and undermines regional security.\n\nThere will be at least a few objections to orienting American policy toward the best possible outcomes in these conflicts \u2014 achieving peace and stability in the near term \u2014 rather than the unrealistic goals of our partners.\n\nWar has a way of eliciting worldviews organized around simplistic binaries. After the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, then-President George W. Bush declared that every country had to decide: \u201cEither you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\u201d When Biden spoke of the war in Ukraine, Americans were told we faced a choice between offering Kyiv unconditional support or \u201cwithdrawing\u201d from the conflict and letting Putin \u201cerase\u201d Ukraine. But these kinds of Manichean views that divide the world into evil aggressors and righteous victims do not make impossible military victories any more achievable.\n\nSome people will say that the US can\u2019t simply tell Ukraine and Israel, both sovereign countries, what to do. Indeed, this has largely been Biden\u2019s public position, evident in his mantra \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and in the State Department\u2019s insistence that \u201cthe United States doesn\u2019t dictate to Israel what it must do.\u201d\n\nThese countries do have agency \u2014 but so does the United States. American involvement in assisting these nations\u2019 war efforts gives it the right and responsibility to share the course of each conflict in ways that protect its interests. The US can respect Ukraine\u2019s and Israel\u2019s agency without subjugating its own.\n\nIn Ukraine, this doesn\u2019t mean threatening the withdrawal of aid, which would weaken its battlefield and negotiating position. Instead, the US could have enforced the restrictions it had already made (on Abrams Tanks, F-16s, cluster munitions and long-range missiles) or it could now materially support diplomatic efforts as enthusiastically as military efforts. However, the recent aid package includes long-range missiles, or ATACMS, which suggests Ukraine is readying an offensive against Crimea. For a year and a half, Biden judiciously refused to send these to Ukraine, calling them a \u201cred line\u201d for Putin, who might use nuclear weapons were Crimea attacked.\n\nIn Israel, putting conditions on military aid is a better idea. The US did use leverage after an Israeli military strike killed aid workers from World Central Kitchen \u2014 with sources telling CNN that Biden warned Netanyahu that the US would reconsider how it\u2019s supporting Israel\u2019s war unless Israel allowed for more humanitarian aid in Gaza. After that, Israel acceded to the ultimatum and, per a reported demand by Biden, publicly announced the change that day. Unfortunately, there\u2019s little evidence the president has kept up the pressure. When the aid package passed Congress, a pro-Israel lobbying group cheered that the security assistance came \u201cwith no added conditions.\u201d\n\nOne historical example illustrates how the US might use its leverage with Netanyahu today. After Israel encircled the Egyptian military in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to Tel Aviv and pressured Prime Minister Golda Meir to enact a ceasefire. Egypt\u2019s attack was, like that of Hamas, an unprovoked and surprise act of aggression. Kissinger feared a victory by the Soviet-backed Arab states. But recently declassified documents show he also feared an all-out Israeli victory.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter.

From an American point of view, it is a disaster.\u201d Kissinger advised that the US needed \u201cto be taken even more seriously\u201d by Israel, and \u201cour insistence on a more politically oriented policy cannot go unheeded.\u201d This advice rings even truer today.\n\nFundamentally, negotiated settlements are often morally unsatisfying.

It is important not to lose this value in these changes, which is European integration, which is our community activity, as well as our use of Europe's potential in this changing geopolitical architecture of the world- said Kwasniewski.\n\n- The Union will change and must change and must have a strong, rational voice of Poland - pro -European, not naive (...).We made the right decision at the right time.We were not late for the history of history, if we did not do it in 2004, we would not be in the EU to this day.We were smart on time - the politician concluded.",

Democratic President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law.\n\nAbout 12% of the uranium used to produce electricity at U.S. nuclear power plants is imported from Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council said Wednesday that Biden shares lawmakers\u2019 concerns about U.S. reliance on Russia for low-enriched uranium to support its domestic nuclear fleet.\n\nIncluded in the administration's announcement are importers of cotton cellulose and nitrocellulose, which are used to produce gunpowder, rocket propellants and other explosives. The penalties also target Russian government entities and people tied to Russia's chemical and biological weapons programs, companies related to Russia's natural gas construction projects and three workers at the penal colony where Navalny died.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has railed against earlier rounds of U.S. and Western penalties, claiming they are \"illegitimate sanctions\" on his country.\n\nA group of 16 targets in China and Hong Kong, most of which are related to Russian procurement workarounds, are named by the Biden administration.\n\nYellen traveled to Guangzhou and Beijing last month to warn Chinese officials that they \"must not provide material support for Russia\u2019s war and that they will face significant consequences if they do.\"\n\nChina has said it is not providing Russia with arms or military assistance, although Beijing has maintained robust economic connections with Moscow, alongside India and other countries, as the West imposes sanctions.\n\nCompanies in China, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were accused of helping Russia acquire technology and equipment from abroad. The penalties aim to block them from using the U.S. financial system and bar American citizens from dealing with them.\n\nBiden last week said he would immediately rush badly needed weaponry to Ukraine as he signed into law a $95 billion war aid measure that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots.\n\nThe upcoming uranium ban is also expected to impact Russian revenues by at least $1 billion.

John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called the import ban \"a tremendous victory\" and said it \"will help defund Russia\u2019s war machine, revive American uranium production and jumpstart investments in America\u2019s nuclear fuel supply chain.\u2033\n\n\"Wyoming has the uranium to replace Russian imports, and we\u2019re ready to use it,\u2033 Barrasso added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who heads that Senate committee, said it was \"unconscionable\" for the U.S. to help make it possible for Putin to \"finance his unlawful war against Ukraine\" through U.S. reliance on Russian uranium.\n\nBesides the import ban, the legislation frees up $2.7 billion in previously authorized funding to ramp up domestic uranium production.",

Some 193 states have ratified the convention.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.\n\nChloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to \"dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions\" - is an oily substance which was widely used during World War One. It causes irritation of the lungs, eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC).\n\nThe chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW.\n\nThe state department also said Moscow had regularly used \"riot control agents,\" or tear gas, during the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has previously warned Russia against deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine. In March 2022, weeks after Moscow launched its invasion, Mr Biden vowed that President Vladimir Putin would pay a \"severe price\" if he did authorise the use of chemical weapons.\n\n\"We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nBut there have been consistent reports that Moscow has ignored that warning. US Assistant Secretary for Arms Control Mallory Stewart has previously said Russia was using riot control agents in the conflict.\n\nAnd Ukraine says its troops have faced mounting chemical attacks in recent months. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this year that Russian forces had used grenades loaded with CS and CN tear gases.\n\nThe report added that at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic gases, and that one had died after suffocating on tear gas.\n\nThree Russian bodies linked to the country's biological and chemical weapons programme were sanctioned by the state department for their links to the production of chemical agents. Other firms that contributed to the government entities were also sanctioned.",

The remaining 37 lawmakers were absent.\n\nUS-SANCTIONED EX-INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WITH RUSSIAN TIES TO BE APPOINTED SERBIAN VICE-PREMIER\n\nThe government includes former intelligence chief Aleksandar Vulin, who has made several visits to Russia in recent months, as one of several vice-premiers, along with Nenad Popovi\u0107, another Russia supporter who has faced U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe foreign minister in the previous government, Ivica Da\u010di\u0107, also a pro-Russia politician, will be in charge of the Interior Ministry in the new Cabinet.\n\nThe vote followed a heated two-day debate. President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107's ruling nationalist conservative Serbian Progressive Party holds a comfortable majority after an election in December that fueled political tensions because of reports of widespread irregularities.\n\nThe increasingly authoritarian Vu\u010di\u0107 has refused to join Western sanctions against Moscow over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, though Serbia has condemned the aggression.\n\nVu\u010devi\u0107, the new prime minister, reiterated that Belgrade doesn't intend to impose sanctions on Russia and \"cannot and will not give up\" its friendship with Russia.

Vulin is also accused of involvement in a drug trafficking ring, according to U.S. authorities.\n\nVulin, who in the past had served as both the army and police chief, has recently received two medals of honor from Russia, one from the Federal Security Service, or FSB, and the other was awarded to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPopovi\u0107, a businessman and a former government minister, has \"used his Russia-based businesses to enrich himself and gain close connections with Kremlin senior leaders,\" the U.S. Treasury said last November in a statement.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Radomir Lazovic criticized the inclusion of the disputed ministers. Lazovic said \"these individuals shouldn\u2019t be part of the government, not just because they are blacklisted, but because their harmful behavior has hurt the citizens of Serbia.\"\n\nThe U.S. sanctions against individuals and companies in the Balkans are designed to counter attempts to undermine peace and stability in the volatile region and Russia's \"malign\" influence.\n\nThe West has stepped up efforts to lure the troubled region into its fold, fearing that Russia could stir unrest to avert attention from the war in Ukraine. The Balkans went through multiple wars in the 1990s, and tensions still persist.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSerbia's falling democracy record has pushed the country away from EU integration, explained Ejdus. Reports of election fraud at the Dec. 17 vote triggered street protests and clashes.\n\n\"Vu\u010di\u0107 is still pretending to be on the EU path because it\u2019s beneficial for Serbia\u2019s economy, and the EU tolerates his authoritarian tendencies out of fear of instability that could be caused in its backyard if Belgrade was lost to Russia and China,\" Ejdus said.",

With Moscow\u2019s troops scoring small advances around the frontline in recent weeks, it doesn\u2019t believe it has to negotiate.\n\nFor Sergey Radchenko, professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), a solution remains far off, despite the efforts: \u201cThe Russians are clearly still hoping to win this war outright, while Ukraine is hoping that they will rally Western support and outlast Russia in the long-term.\u201d\n\nHe is also sceptical of a summit going ahead without Russia.\n\n\u201cAn eventual ceasefire agreement/peace treaty would have to involve Russia: there is no way around it because a negotiation that does not involve a key party is more of a solidarity exercise than a true negotiation,\u201d Radchenko told Euractiv.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the June talks, Ukraine and its Western allies want to rally broader international support for Kyiv, campaigning to persuade as many non-Western countries as possible to attend.\n\nDiplomats involved in the preparations say there are fears the summit threatens to become a Western affair, without strong Global South participation.\n\nWhile previous rounds of preparatory meetings managed to attract more non-Western states, it might be more difficult to secure the same when it comes to higher-level participation from those countries, they worry.\n\nChina, which experts say is unlikely to renounce support for Russia, has warned it won\u2019t participate if Russia isn\u2019t represented.\n\nFurther conditions for China to participate include confirmation that it will not amount to a full-blown summit so that they could send an envoy instead of a high-ranking politician, as well as their and other peace blueprints to be considered, people with knowledge of the discussion said.\n\n\u201cI do not think that the purpose \u2013 rallying the Global South and/or China \u2013 will be served particularly well by [not inviting Russia], as we already have witnessed from earlier gatherings, like in Malta,\u201d Radchenko said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the perspective of Western diplomats, it is clear that if Beijing, Moscow\u2019s most important ally, does not take part, the summit can hardly be a success.\n\nThat being said, EU officials are increasingly sceptical about the role Beijing can play in any future peace process.\n\nWith Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s trip to Europe, they hope Beijing\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine will be a key topic and Europeans will be able to convince Beijing it is in its interest to play a greater role in ending the Ukraine war.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said he will ask Xi to commit to that goal when he visits Paris, which is preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer.\n\nIt is customary where peace is expected to be upheld during the Olympics, but the 2008 Games in Beijing did not halt Russia\u2019s August invasion of Georgia back then.\n\nAt the same time, Western officials fear the next few weeks might be marked by Russia making more tactical gains in eastern Ukraine, especially around the key June date.\n\nA changed reality on the ground could change the dynamics of the talks, with increased pressure about the need to kickstart actual peace talks, they worry.\n\n\u201cA conference that actually aims to achieve a breakthrough would have to entail a protracted negotiation between a very limited number of parties,\u201d Radchenko said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment what we are seeing is a tendency towards a short PR event with a large number of parties, except the ones that matter,\u201d he added.",

Russian officials consistently time nuclear readiness exercises and vague threats of nuclear retaliation with important Western policy decisions regarding the war in Ukraine to force Western decision-makers to self-deter and temper their support for Ukraine.\n\nThe current apparent resurgence of nuclear rhetoric, this time in the form of planned tactical nuclear weapons exercises, coincides with the imminent arrival of Western weapons in Ukraine, analysts said.\n\n\"Russian officials are likely using the nuclear weapons information operation to discourage Ukraine's Western partners from providing additional military support and to scare Western decision-makers out of allowing Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided systems to attack legitimate military targets in Russia,\" ISW said.\n\nRussian troops engage in routine nuclear exercises as part of this wider nuclear rhetoric information operation, but ISW continues to assess that Russia is highly unlikely to use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine or anywhere else.",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin began his fifth term as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office after destroying his political opponents, launching a devastating war in Ukraine and concentrating all power in his hands.\n\nAlready in office for nearly a quarter-century and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Mr Putin\u2019s new term does not expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.\n\nAt the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Mr Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.\n\n\u201cWe are a united and great people and together we will overcome all obstacles, realise all our plans, together we will win,\u201d Mr Putin said after being sworn in.\n\nHe used the the first moments of his fifth term to thank the \u201cheroes\u201d of his war in Ukraine and to rail against the West.\n\nRussia \u201cdoes not refuse dialogue with Western states\u201d, he said.\n\nRather, he said, \u201cthe choice is theirs: do they intend to continue trying to contain Russia, continue the policy of aggression, continuous pressure on our country for years, or look for a path to cooperation and peace\u201d.\n\nSince succeeding President Boris Yeltsin in the waning hours of 1999, Mr Putin has transformed Russia from a country emerging from economic collapse to a pariah state that threatens global security.\n\nFollowing the 2022 invasion of Ukraine that has become Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since the Second World War, Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran and North Korea for support.\n\nHonour guards of the Presidential regiment carry a special copy of the Russian Constitution and the President\u2019s Badge (Alexander Kazakov/AP)\n\nThe question now is what the 71-year-old Mr Putin will do over the course of another six years, both at home and abroad.\n\nRussian forces are gaining ground in Ukraine, deploying scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv grapples with shortages of men and ammunition.\n\nBoth sides are taking heavy casualties.\n\nUkraine has brought the battle to Russian soil through drone and missile attacks, especially in border regions.\n\nVladimir Putin arrives for the ceremony (Sergei Bobylev/AP)\n\nIn a speech in February, Mr Putin vowed to fulfil Moscow\u2019s goals in Ukraine, and do what is needed to \u201cdefend our sovereignty and security of our citizens.\u201d\n\nShortly after his orchestrated re-election in March, Mr Putin suggested that a confrontation between Nato and Russia is possible, and he declared he wanted to carve out a buffer zone in Ukraine to protect his country from cross-border attacks.\n\nAt home, Mr Putin\u2019s popularity is closely tied to improving living standards for ordinary Russians.\n\nHe began his term in 2018 by promising to get Russia into the top five global economies, vowing it should be \u201cmodern and dynamic\u201d.\n\nRussian biker group the Night Wolves leader Alexander Zaldostanov, also known as Khirurg (the Surgeon), arrives for Vladimir Putin\u2019s inauguration ceremony (Alexander Nemenov/AP)\n\nInstead, Russia\u2019s economy has pivoted to a war footing, and authorities are spending record amounts on defence.\n\nAnalysts say now that Mr Putin has secured another six years in power, the government could take the unpopular steps of raising taxes to fund the war and pressure more men to join the military.\n\nAt the start of a new term, the Russian government is routinely dissolved so that Mr Putin can name a new prime minister and Cabinet.\n\nOne key area to watch is the defence ministry.\n\nLast year, defence minister Sergei Shoigu came under pressure over his conduct of the war, with mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin launching withering criticism against him for shortages of ammunition for his private contractors fighting in Ukraine.\n\nMr Prigozhin\u2019s brief uprising in June against the defence ministry represented the biggest threat to Mr Putin\u2019s rule.\n\nAfter Mr Prigozhin was killed two months later in a mysterious plane crash, Mr Shoigu appeared to have survived the infighting.\n\nBut last month, his protege, deputy defence minister Timur Ivanov, was detained on charges of bribery amid reports of rampant corruption.\n\nSome analysts have suggested Mr Shoigu could become a victim of the government reshuffle but that would be a bold move as the war is still raging in Ukraine.\n\nIn the years following the invasion, authorities have cracked down on any form of dissent with a ferocity not seen since Soviet times.\n\nThere is no sign that this repression will ease in Mr Putin\u2019s new term.\n\nHis greatest political foe, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony in February.\n\nOther prominent critics have either been imprisoned or have fled the country, and even some of his opponents abroad fear for their security.\n\nLaws have been enacted that threaten long prison terms for anyone who discredits the military.\n\nThe Kremlin also targets independent media, rights groups, LGBTQ+ activists and others who do not adhere to what Mr Putin has emphasised as Russia\u2019s \u201ctraditional family values\u201d.",

        "content": "Yelizaveta Antonova leaves the journalism college at St. Petersburg State University. She believes a protest of an attack on a reporter cost her a spot in graduate school. (Ksenia Ivanova for The Washington Post)\n\nTwo weeks before the start of his 25th year as Russia\u2019s supreme political leader, Vladimir Putin made a sweeping proclamation: \u201cWars are won by teachers.\u201d The remark, which Putin repeated twice during his year-end news conference in December, shed light on a campaign he is waging that has received little attention outside wartime Russia: to imbue the country\u2019s education system with patriotism, purge universities of Western influences, and quash any dissent among professors and students on campuses that are often hotbeds of political activism.\n\nAt St. Petersburg State University, this meant dismantling a prestigious humanities program called the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences. For more than a decade, until May 2022, the faculty \u2014 or college \u2014 was led by Alexei Kudrin, a liberal economist and former finance minister who had been a close associate of Putin\u2019s since the early 1990s, when they were deputy mayors together in St. Petersburg.\n\n\u201cWe had many classes on U.S. history, American political life, democracy and political thought, as well as courses on Russian history and political science, history of U.S.-Russian relations, and even a course titled \u2018The ABCs of War: Causes, Effects, Consequences,\u2019\u201d said a student at the faculty, also known as Smolny College. \u201cThey are all gone now,\u201d the student said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nSkip to end of carousel About this series \u201cRussia, Remastered\u201d examines how Vladimir Putin, stoking conflict with the West and risking a new world war, is harnessing his invasion of Ukraine to transform Russia and fulfill his revanchist vision of a restored superpower. End of carousel In a radical reshaping of Russia\u2019s education system, curriculums are being redrawn to stress patriotism and textbooks rewritten to belittle Ukraine, glorify Russia and whitewash the totalitarian Soviet past. These changes \u2014 the most sweeping to schooling in Russia since the 1930s \u2014 are a core part of Putin\u2019s effort to harness the war in Ukraine to remaster his country as a regressive, militarized state.\n\nSince the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leaders of Russian universities, which are overwhelmingly funded by the state, have zealously adopted the Kremlin\u2019s intolerance of any dissent or self-organization, according to an extensive examination by The Washington Post of events on campuses across Russia, including interviews with students and professors both still in the country and in exile.\n\nProfessors who spoke out against the war, or allowed safe spaces for students to question it, have been fired. Students who picketed or posted on social media for peace were expelled.\n\nMeanwhile, those who volunteer to fight in Ukraine have been celebrated in line with Putin\u2019s promises that war heroes and their descendants will become the new Russian elite, with enhanced social benefits, including special preference for children seeking to enter top academic programs. Normally, such programs require near-perfect grades and high scores on competitive exams \u2014 uniform standards that applicants from all societal backgrounds have relied on for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the most fundamental precept of academic life \u2014 the freedom to think independently, to challenge conventional assumptions and pursue new, bold ideas \u2014 has been eroded by edicts that classrooms become echo chambers of the authoritarian nativism and historical distortions that Putin uses to justify his war and his will.\n\nAs a result, a system of higher learning that once was a beacon for students across the developing world is now shutting itself off from peer academies in the West, severing one of the few ties that had survived years of political turbulence. Freedom of thought is being trampled, if not eradicated. Eminent scholars have fled for positions abroad, while others said in interviews that they are planning to do so.\n\nAt the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, officials last July created the Ivan Ilyin Higher Political School, which is now being led by Alexander Dugin, a fervent pro-Putin and Orthodox Christian ideologue who was tasked with \u201crevising domestic scientific and educational paradigms and bringing them into line with our traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been a catastrophic degradation in Western humanitarian history,\u201d Dugin said at a January seminar on transforming Russian humanities education. \u201cThis is evidenced by gender problems, postmodernism and ultraliberalism. We can study the West, but not as the ultimate universal truth. We need to focus on our own Russian development model.\u201d\n\nSkip to end of carousel How we reported \u2018Russia, Remastered\u2019 arrow left arrow right For this article, Russia reporter Mary Iluyshina reported from Riga, Latvia, and Berlin, communicating by phone and social media with Russian students and professors in the country and those who have fled. Many experienced the transformation of Russia\u2019s educational system firsthand. Information they provided was corroborated by court documents, independent Russian news accounts, social media posts, and other documentary evidence. The Post also relied on Kremlin transcripts of remarks by President Vladimir, government decrees, and official statements issued by universities. Photographer Ksenia Ivanova reported from St. Petersburg. Reporting on Russia is challenging, and it has grown more difficult since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At times, people in Russia are afraid to speak with journalists or to say things that they worry could provoke the authorities. Many people in Russia avoid speaking in public about politics or the war in Ukraine, fearing they could be reported to the authorities by neighbors or by classmates . Some analysts still inside the country are known to comment carefully, wary of provoking the Kremlin. For these reasons, The Post agreed to withhold the identities of some people interviewed who expressed concerns about their safety. For those reluctant to meet in person because of security concerns, we agreed to conduct interviews on encrypted internet platforms. Mary Ilyushina, a Post reporter covering Russia since 2021, previously worked for CNN\u2019s Moscow bureau as a field producer. She speaks Russian, English, Ukrainian and Arabic and is a graduate of Moscow State University. Robyn Dixon, The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau chief since November 2019, is on her third stint covering Russia, having had previous assignments with the Los Angeles Times and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age dating back to 1993. She speaks Russian, French and English. Francesca Ebel, a Russia correspondent for The Post since November 2022, previously covered Russia and Ukraine as a multimedia journalist for the Associated Press was an AP correspondent based in Tunis. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in medieval and modern languages from Cambridge University, where she studied Russian, Ukrainian and French. Natalia Abbakumova has been a researcher and translator in The Post\u2019s Moscow bureau since 2001, collaborating during that time with 10 bureau chiefs. Previously, she worked briefly for The Economist. She holds a degree in foreign languages (English and German) from Moscow Linguistic University. 1 / 4 End of carousel Last month, students pushed an online petition to protest the naming of the school after Ilyin, a philosopher who defended Hitler and Mussolini in World War II and advocated for the return of czarist autocracy in Russia. In a statement to Tass, the state-controlled news service, the university denounced the petition as \u201cpart of the information war of the West and its supporters against Russia\u201d and asserted, without providing evidence, that the group behind it had no connection to students at the school. Programs specializing in the liberal arts and sciences are primary targets because they are viewed as breeding grounds for dissent. Major universities have cut the hours spent studying Western governments, human rights and international law, and even the English language. \u201cWe were destroyed,\u201d said Denis Skopin, a philosophy professor at Smolny College who was fired for criticizing the war. \u201cBecause the last thing people who run universities need are unreliable actors who do the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing, think in a different way, and teach their students to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College The demise of Smolny College\n\nSt. Petersburg State University, commonly known as SPbU, has long been one of Russia\u2019s premier academies of higher learning. It is the alma mater of both Putin, who graduated with a degree in law in 1975, and former president Dmitry Medvedev, who received his law degree 12 years later and now routinely threatens nuclear strikes on the West as deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s national security council.\n\nIn many ways, the university has become the leader in reprisals against students and staff not loyal to the Kremlin, with one newspaper dubbing it the \u201crepressions champion\u201d of Russian education. Its halls have become a microcosm of modern Russia in which conservatives in power are pushing out the few remaining Western-oriented liberals.\n\nLike other aspects of Putin\u2019s remastering of Russia \u2014 such as patriotic mandates in the arts and the redrawing of the role of women to focus on childbearing \u2014 the shift in education started well before the invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, Russia ended a more than 20-year-old exchange program between Smolny College and Bard College in New York state by designating the private American liberal arts school an \u201cundesirable\u201d organization.\n\nJonathan Becker, Bard\u2019s vice president for academic affairs and a professor of political studies, said the demise of Smolny was emblematic of a wider shift in Russia as well as a new intolerance of the West.\n\n\u201cA huge number of faculty have been let go, several departments closed, core liberal arts programs which focus on critical thinking have been eliminated,\u201d Becker said. \u201cAll of that has happened, and it\u2019s not just happened at Smolny \u2014 it has happened elsewhere. But we were doubly problematic because we both represent critical thinking and partnership with the West. And neither of those are acceptable in present-day Russia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2022, in a scene captured on video and posted on social media, dozens of students gathered in a courtyard to bid a tearful goodbye to Skopin, Smolny\u2019s cherished philosophy professor who was fired for an \u201cimmoral act\u201d \u2014 protesting Putin\u2019s announcement of a partial military mobilization to replenish his depleted forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe month before, according to court records and interviews, Skopin was arrested at an antiwar rally. He ended up sharing a jail cell with another professor, Artem Kalmykov, a young mathematician who had recently finished his PhD at the University of Zurich.\n\nThat fall, the university launched an overhaul that all but shut Smolny College and replaced the curriculum with a thoroughly revamped arts and humanities program.\n\nThe dismantling of Smolny marked the resolution of a years-long feud between Kudrin, the liberal-economist dean, and Nikolai Kropachev, the university rector, whom tutors and students described as a volatile character with a passion for building ties in the highest echelons of the government.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College \u201c It\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it.\u201d Denis Skopin Former philosophy professor at Smolny College\n\nIn February, Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service, sent a heartfelt birthday message to Kropachev, thanking him for his \u201ccivic and political activity\u201d and for \u201ccomprehensive assistance in replenishing personnel.\u201d\n\nOne student described how Kropachev once interrupted a meeting with students and hinted that he needed to take a call from Putin, in what the student viewed as a boast of his direct access to the Russian leader. Both St. Petersburg State University and Moscow State University were assigned a special status in 2009, under which their rectors are appointed personally by the president.\n\nSkopin, who earned his PhD in France, and his cellmate, Kalmykov, were perfect examples of the type of academic that Russia aspired to attract from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s \u2014 enticed after studying abroad to bring knowledge home amid booming investment in higher education. But by 2022, the system seemed to have no need for them.\n\nVideo of the gathering in the courtyard shows students erupting in sustained applause, and one student coming forward to hug Skopin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe the insane level of anxiety the students felt at the start of the invasion, and I\u2019d say 99 percent of them were against it,\u201d Skopin said.\n\nAfter his dismissal, some students tried to fight the administration\u2019s plan to dismantle the Smolny program.\n\n\u201cAt one point we found ourselves in a situation where out of 30 original faculty staff, we had just three tutors left,\u201d said Polina Ulanovskaya, a sociology student and activist who led the student union. \u201cAnd the quality of education definitely suffered, especially all of the politics-related classes.\u201d\n\nUlanovskaya said that on the political science track, only two professors have stayed, and many classes were eliminated, including a human rights course. There are now just two courses offered in English, down from 21.\n\nWith every new professor, Ulanovskaya said, she felt a need to test the waters. Would the word \u201cgender\u201d trigger them? Could she say something opposition-leaning? What would be a red flag?\n\nUlanovskaya opted out of writing a thesis on her main research topic \u2014 Russian social movements, politicization of workers and historic-preservation activists \u2014 out of fear that it would be blacklisted. Instead, she wrote about Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe main problem at the faculty now is that there is no freedom and especially no sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess there is no such thing anywhere in Russia now ... you can\u2019t trust anyone in any university.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after The Post interviewed Ulanovskaya last fall, she was expelled, formally for failing an exam, but she and Skopin said they believe it was retaliation for her activism.\n\nAnother student, Yelizaveta Antonova, was supposed to get her bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism just days after legendary Novaya Gazeta newspaper reporter Yelena Milashina was brutally beaten in Chechnya, the small Muslim-majority republic in southern Russia under the dictatorial rule of Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nAntonova, who interned at Novaya Gazeta and looked up to Milashina, felt she could not accept her diploma without showing support for her colleague. She and a roommate printed a photo of Milashina, depicting the reporter\u2019s shaved head and bandaged hands, to stage a demonstration at their graduation ceremony \u2014 much to the dismay of other classmates, who sought to block the protest.\n\n\u201cThey essentially prevented us from going on stage,\u201d Antonova said. \u201cSo we did it outside of the law school, and we felt it was extra symbolic because Putin and Medvedev studied in these halls.\u201d\n\nThey held up the poster for about half an hour, until another student threatened them by saying riot police were on the way to arrest them. Antonova believes the protest cost her a spot in graduate school, where she hoped to continue her research comparing Russia\u2019s media landscape before and after the invasion.\n\nEight months after the graduation ceremony, authorities launched a case against Antonova and her roommate for staging an unauthorized demonstration \u2014 an administrative offense that is punishable by a fine and puts people on law enforcement\u2019s radar. Antonova left the country to continue her studies abroad.\n\nIdeological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides Ideological divides\n\nThe history college at St. Petersburg State has long been a battleground for various ideologies, with cliques ranging from conservatives and Kremlin loyalists to unyielding opposition-minded liberals, according to interviews with students and professors.\n\nThe February 2022 invasion of Ukraine caused a deeper split. Some students and professors openly praised Putin\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d as the Kremlin called the war, while others joined rallies against it.\n\n\u201cThe war gave them carte blanche,\u201d said Michael Martin, 22, a former star at the college \u2014 to which he was automatically admitted after winning two nationwide academic competitions and where he earned straight A\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartin was a leader of the student council, which on the day of the invasion issued an antiwar manifesto quickly drafted in a cafe.\n\nAnother history student, Fedor Solomonov, took the opposite view and praised the special military operation on social media. When Solomonov was called up as part of the mobilization, he declined to take a student deferral and went to fight. He died on the front on April 1, 2023.\n\nSoon after Solomonov\u2019s death, screenshots from internal chats where students often debated history and politics were leaked and went viral on pro-war Telegram channels. In some, Martin and other classmates expressed antiwar sentiments, while another showed a message \u2014 allegedly written by an assistant professor, Mikhail Belousov \u2014 vaguely describing events in Ukraine as \u201cRashism,\u201d a wordplay combining \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201cfascism.\u201d\n\nIn an aggressive online campaign, pro-war activists demanded that Belousov, who denied writing the message, be fired and that the antiwar students, whom they labeled \u201ca pro-Ukrainian organized crime group,\u201d be expelled.\n\n\u201cA cell of anti-Russian students led by a Russophobe associate professor is operating at the history faculty,\u201d read posts on Readovka, a radical outlet with 2.5 million followers. \u201cThey are rabid liberals who hate their country.\u201d Belousov was dismissed and seven students, including Martin, were accused of desecrating Solomonov\u2019s memory and expelled.\n\nBelousov has gone underground and could not be reached for comment.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThey essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil,\u201d Martin said, recalling the expulsion hearing, where he said the committee repeatedly asked leading questions trying to get him to say the war was justified. The committee also asked him repeatedly about Solomonov.\n\n\u201cI said he was for the war and I was against it \u2014 we could argue about that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t find anything funny or interesting in this \u2014 I\u2019m truly sorry for what happened to him, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that he did something good or great by going to war.\u201d\n\nMartin said that as the war raged on, the university began \u201cglorifying death\u201d and praising alumni who had joined the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis narrative also warped the curriculum.\n\nA few weeks into the invasion, the school introduced a class on modern Ukrainian history, with a course description asserting that Ukrainian statehood is based \u201con a certain mythology.\u201d\n\n\u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University \u201c They essentially tried to make me do the Sieg Heil.\u201d Michael Martin Former student at St. Petersburg State University\n\nBelousov, the former assistant professor, criticized a course titled \u201cThe Great Patriotic War: No Statute of Limitations,\u201d taught by an instructor with a degree in library science. The key message of the course is that the Soviet Union had no role in the start of World War II \u2014 a denial of Russia\u2019s joint invasion of Poland with Nazi Germany in 1939.\n\nAccording to a government document reviewed by The Post, Russia\u2019s Higher Education Ministry plans to introduce this course at other universities to ensure the \u201ccivic-patriotic and spiritual-moral education of youth,\u201d specifically future lawyers, teachers and historians, and to \u201ccorrect false ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are obviously propaganda courses that are aimed at turning historians into court apologists,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMartin was expelled days before he was supposed to defend his thesis. He quickly left the country after warnings that he and his classmates could be charged with discrediting the army, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. A criminal case was initiated against Belousov on charges of rehabilitating Nazism.\n\n\u201cThis is all very reminiscent of the Stalinist 1930s purges,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe limit of tolerated protest now is to sit silently and say nothing. There is despair at the faculty and a feeling that they have crushed everything.\u201d\n\nNew Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite New Russian elite\n\nTo lure more Russian men to fight in Ukraine, the government has promised their families various sweeteners, including cheap mortgages, large life insurance payments and education benefits for their children.\n\nIn 2022, Putin approved changes to education laws to grant children of soldiers who fought in Ukraine admissions preferences at Russia\u2019s best universities \u2014 schools that normally accept only students with near-perfect exam scores and impressive high school records.\n\nNow, at least 10 percent of all fully funded university spots must be allocated to students eligible for the military preference. Those whose fathers were killed or wounded do not need to pass entry exams.\n\nThe new law solidified a previous Putin decree that gave special preferences to soldiers and their children. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 8,500 students were enrolled based on these preferences, government officials said. According to an investigation by the Russian-language outlet Important Stories, nearly 900 students were admitted to 13 top universities through war quotas, with most failing to meet the normal exam score threshold.\n\nIn areas of Ukraine captured by Russian forces since February 2022, a different takeover of the education system is underway, with Moscow imposing its curriculum and standards just as it did after invading and illegally annexing Crimea in 2014.\n\nFor the 2023-24 academic year, according to the Russian prime minister\u2019s office, more than 5 percent of fully state-financed tuition stipends \u2014 roughly 37,000 out of 626,000 \u2014 were allocated for students at universities in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson or Zaporizhzhia, the four occupied or partly occupied areas of Ukraine that Putin has claimed to be annexed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relatively large allocation of tuition aid in occupied areas shows how financial assistance and education are central to Putin\u2019s effort to seize lands in southeast Ukraine and absorb its population into Russia in violation of international law.\n\nDeans of several leading Russian universities have made highly publicized trips to occupied Ukraine to urge students there to enroll into Russian schools, part of a multipronged effort to bring residents into Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe Moscow-based Higher School of Economics, once considered Russia\u2019s most liberal university, recently established patronage over universities in Luhansk, with Rector Nikita Anisimov often traveling there.\n\nAn inward turn An inward turn An inward turn An inward turn\n\nA few weeks after the invasion started, Moscow abandoned the Bologna Process, a pan-European effort to align higher education standards, as Russia\u2019s deans and rectors strove to show they weren\u2019t susceptible to foreign influence.\n\nHigher Education Minister Valery Falkov said Russian universities would undergo significant changes in the next half-decade, overseen by the national program \u201cPriority 2030,\u201d which envisions curriculums that ensure \u201cformation of a patriotic worldview in young people.\u201d\n\nSoon after Russia quit the Bologna Process, Smolny College was targeted for overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe decision was an expected but distinct shift from the more liberal model of Russian higher education policy that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union,\u201d said Victoria Pardini, a program associate at the Kennan Institute, a Washington think tank focused on Russia.\n\nAnother prestigious school, the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, canceled its liberal arts program in 2022 after authorities accused it of \u201cdestroying national values.\u201d\n\nIn mid-October 2023, the Higher Education Ministry ordered universities to avoid open discussion of \u201cnegative political, economic and social trends,\u201d according to a publicly disclosed report by British intelligence. \u201cIn the longer term, this will likely further the trend of Russian policymaking taking place in an echo-chamber,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nRussia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2014 2018 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge Russia\u2019s position among countries by number of scholarly papers published 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 1st 5th 7th 10th 11th 15th 15th Source: Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge\n\nMany international exchange programs have been canceled \u2014 some because Russian students now have difficulty obtaining visas.

Cameron's hostile attack directly contradicts the previously sounded assurances of the British side when transferring long-range cruise missiles to the Kyiv regime, that under no circumstances would they be used on Russian territory,\" the statement continued. \"Thus, the head of the Foreign Office disavowed this position, de facto recognizing his country as a party to the conflict.\"\n\nThe ministry said that the Russian side \"views D. Cameron's words as evidence of a serious escalation and confirmation of London's increasing involvement in military operations on the side of Kyiv.\"\n\nUS ARMY SOLDIER DETAINED IN RUSSIA, CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT: OFFICIALS\n\n\"N. Casey was warned that the response to Ukrainian strikes using British weapons on Russian territory could be any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and beyond,\" the ministry said. \"The Ambassador was called upon to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London and to immediately refute in the most decisive and unequivocal manner the bellicose provocative statements of the head of the Foreign Office.\"\n\nThe remarks came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nDrills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons come in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" Russia's Defense Ministry also said in a statement. It was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield.

Some of Ukraine\u2019s Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and Cameron said Kyiv\u2019s forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\n\"Ukraine has that right. Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" Cameron told Reuters last week.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron\u2019s recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It\u2019s a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It\u2019s unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry also summoned France's ambassador.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Read more CNN Opinion.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOn Thursday Russia will celebrate Victory Day, its commemoration of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Domestically, this is nostalgia. In the 1970s, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev created a cult of victory. Russia under Putin has continued the tradition.\n\nAbroad, this is intimidation. We are meant to think that Russia cannot lose.\n\nAnd far too many of us, during Russia\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine, have believed that. In February 2022, when Russia undertook its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, the consensus was that Ukraine would fall within days.\n\nEven today, when Ukraine has held its own for more than two years, the prevailing view among Russia\u2019s friends in Congress and in the Senate is that Russia must eventually win. Moscow\u2019s success is not on the battlefield, but in our minds.\n\nRussia can lose. And it should lose, for the sake of the world \u2014 and for its own sake.\n\nRussian soldiers patrol Mariupol's drama theater, southeastern Ukraine, in March 2022. Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe notion of an invincible Red Army is propaganda. The Red Army was formidable, but it was also beatable. Of its three most consequential foreign wars, the Red Army lost two.\n\nIt was defeated by Poland in 1920. It defeated Nazi Germany in 1945, after nearly collapsing in 1941. (Its win in that instance was part of a larger coalition and with decisive American economic assistance.) Soviet forces were in trouble in Afghanistan immediately after their 1979 invasion and had to withdraw a decade later.\n\nAnd the Russian army of today is not the Red Army. Russia is not the USSR. Soviet Ukraine was a source of resources and soldiers for the Red Army. In that victory of 1945, Ukrainian soldiers in the Red Army took huge losses \u2014 greater than American, British and French losses combined. It was disproportionately Ukrainians who fought their war to Berlin in the uniform of the Red Army.\n\nToday, Russia is fighting not together with Ukraine but against Ukraine. It is fighting a war of aggression on the territory of another state. And it lacks the American economic support \u2014 Lend-Lease \u2014 that the Red Army needed to defeat Nazi Germany. In this constellation, there is no particular reason to expect Russia to win. One would expect, instead, that Russia\u2019s only chance is to prevent the West from helping Ukraine \u2014 by persuading us that its victory is inevitable, so that we don\u2019t apply our decisive economic power.\n\nThe last six months bear this out: Russia\u2019s minor battlefield victories came at a time when the United States was delaying Ukraine aid, rather than supplying it.\n\nToday\u2019s Russia is a new state. It has existed since 1991. Like Brezhnev before him, Russian President Vladimir Putin rules through nostalgia. He refers to the Soviet and also the Russian imperial past. But the Russian Empire also lost wars. It lost the Crimean War in 1856. It lost the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It lost the First World War in 1917. In none of those three cases was Russia able to keep forces in the field for more than about three years.\n\nIn the United States there is great nervousness about a Russian defeat. If something seems impossible, we cannot imagine what could happen next. And so there is a tendency, even among supporters of Ukraine, to think that the best resolution is a tie.\n\nSuch thinking is unrealistic. And it reveals, behind the nerves, a strange American conceit.\n\nNo one can guide a war in such a way. And nothing in our prior attempts to influence Russia suggests that we can exercise that kind of influence. Russia and Ukraine are both fighting to win. The questions are: who will win, and with what consequences?\n\nIf Russia wins, the consequences are horrifying: a risk of a larger war in Europe, more likelihood of a Chinese adventure in the Pacific, the weakening of international legal order generally, the likely spread of nuclear weapons, the loss of faith in democracy.\n\nSoviet soldiers during a patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan, April 25, 1988. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in late 1979 and remained there until 1989. Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nIt is normal for Russia to lose wars. And, in general, this led Russians to reflect and reform. Defeat in Crimea forced an autocracy to end serfdom. Russia\u2019s loss to Japan led to an experiment with elections. The Soviet failure in Afghanistan led to Gorbachev\u2019s reforms and thus the end of the cold war.\n\nBeneath the Russian particularities, history offers a more general and still more reassuring lesson about empires. Russia is fighting today an imperial war. It denies the existence of the Ukrainian state and nation, and it carries out atrocities that recall the worst of the European imperial past.\n\nThe peaceful Europe of today consists of powers that lost their last imperial wars and then chose democracy. It is not only possible to lose your last imperial war: it is also good, not only for the world, but for you.\n\nRussia can lose this war, and should, for the sake of Russians themselves. A defeated Russia means not only the end of senseless losses of young life in Ukraine. It is also Russia\u2019s one chance to become a post-imperial country, one where reform is possible, one where Russians themselves might be protected by law and able to cast meaningful votes.\n\nDefeat in Ukraine is Russia\u2019s historical chance for normality \u2014 as Russians who want democracy and the rule of law will say.\n\nLike the United States and Europe, Ukraine celebrates the victory of 1945 on May 8th rather than May 9th. Ukrainians have every right to remember and interpret that victory: they suffered more than Russians from German occupation and died in huge numbers on the battlefield.\n\nAnd Ukrainians are right to think that Russia today, like Nazi Germany in 1945, is a fascist imperialist regime that can and must be defeated. Fascism was defeated last time because a coalition held firm and applied its superior economic power. The same holds true now.",

        "content": "During these May days, when we remember our common victory - the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, we would like to recall the words of the Belarusian president: \u201cThe more time passes from the heroic and tragic events, the more we venerate the sacrificial feat of our grandfathers and great grandfathers, those, who saved the mankind from enslavement and extermination.\u201d But let's figure out why the more time passes, the stronger is our desire to stand up for truth and justice, and the more fiercely the West holds onto global dominance. Why the farther we are from those events, the more careful we are of our historical memory and the more barbaric our neighbors are towards war monuments. The war crimes have no statute of limitations, do they? We discuss this in a new episode of BelTA\u2019s Youtube project \u201cAfter the Fact: Lukashenko\u2019s Decisions\u201d.\n\nWhat was the war for Belarusians?\n\nSome chided Belarus for its over-focus on the war commemoration as if no important events happened ever since. To be honest, until recently, some of us teased the older generation over their \"anything but war\" mantra and the traditional wishes for a peaceful sky. It turned out that it was a mistake. Big mistake.\n\nThe great Russian commander Alexander Suvorov is credited with the following words: \u201cThe war is not over until the last soldier is buried!\" He is believed to have said them after the defeat of the Turkish army at the Battle of Rymnik. Russia lost a couple of hundred people in that battle\u2026\n\nNow let's get back to our history. In April 2021, the General Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal case into the genocide of the population of Belarus during the Great Patriotic War and the post-war period. the German invaders and their accomplices killed more than three million Belarusians. Almost 400,000 people were taken to Germany for slave labor. More than 12,000 villages were completely or partially destroyed. Several hundred of them shared the sad fate of Khatyn. More than 580 death camps were established on the territory of our country, and almost 200 major punitive operations were carried out. \"The investigation of the criminal case into the genocide of the Belarusian people continues. For a little more than three years of the investigation, we obtained the information confirming that the scale of the tragedy during the Great Patriotic War is much greater than previously thought. One of the goals of the investigation is to establish all the facts of the genocide that took place on the territory of our country during the Great Patriotic War. But the most important goal is to bring to justice all Nazi criminals who committed atrocities against the Belarusian people. We are moving towards this goal. As part of the criminal case we have put together a list of henchmen and their accomplices that will soon be persecuted by the Prosecutor General of Belarus,\u201d said Sergei Shikunets, Deputy Head of the Department for Supervision over the Investigation of Particularly Important Criminal Cases of the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\nIf we apply Suvorov's words to our realities, will the war ever end for Belarusians?\n\nThis is why the memory of those who died in the fight for the freedom and independence of our Motherland, for the liberation of the planet from Nazism, the memory of the victims of Nazism is sacred for our people. This has become part of the national idea.\n\n\u201cRecently we hear more people say: \u2018What do we need this for. Let us forget everything\u2019. A hideous thing hides behind these seemingly harmless words. It is an attempt not only to forget but also rewrite the history of the war, take away the feat of our people. We must not forget it. We must not give Great Victory away. It is a testimony of the greatness of the Soviet people whose descendants we are,\u201d Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said at a ceremony to unveil the Trostenets Memorial in 2015.\n\nApproaches by Belarus and its neighbors to honoring the past\n\nLet's compare. In 2020, the Ola memorial was opened in Svetlogorsk District on the site of the village destroyed during the war. Almost 2,000 people were burned here, more than half of them were children. That's twelve Khatyns! In the same year, a monument to the burned villages was dedicated in Mogilev Oblast.\n\nTwo years ago, the Khatyn memorial complex was declared an all-Belarusian construction site. Student teams from all over Belarus worked here. The project was financed from the budget and also with the money earned during the national cleanup day. All in all, about Br5 million was spent on the renovation of the memorial. Roughly speaking, it was $1.5-2 million. In 2023, more than 500,000 people visited Khatyn, which was almost twice as many as in previous years. Such a flow of tourists was associated with the opening of a unique museum here.\n\nAt the same time, Latvia was busy too: the Riga City Council proposed to demolish the monument to the Liberators of Riga. This idea was supported by the president of the country. The city authorities bulldozed the flowers laid at the memorial, opened criminal and administrative cases against the protesters, promised to expel from the country all foreigners who joined the protesters... It came to the point of absurd: they decided to drain the pond near the monument and feed the fish to animals in Riga Zoo. The dismantling of the memorial in honor of Soviet soldiers cost \u20ac2 million. It turned out that this was just the beginning: the Latvian government had prepared a list of 69 Soviet war memorials to be demolished.\n\nLatvia\u2019s actions were not unique for Europe. Poland has been implementing its decommunization law since 2017. The dismantling of Soviet monuments and memorials in honor of the liberators has become almost a national idea in Estonia and Lithuania. Ukraine has eagerly joined this dance on the bones.\n\nIt became almost a matter of honor for Kiev to replace the Soviet emblem on Europe\u2019s highest monument with the Ukrainian trident coat of arms. The project to \u2018decommunize\u2019 the Ukrainian Motherland monument cost about $500,000. This is not about money (although it could have been used to address more pressing problems in Ukraine). The question is whether such \u201crebranding\u201d made Ukraine greater. After all Kiev, Minsk, Moscow, and other capitals of the post-Soviet republics survived thanks to those whom these monuments commemorate!\n\n\u201cToday you and I wonder about the same thing: could the heroes of the war have imagined that 80 years later their children and grandchildren would have to fight for the truth about the Great Victory, for the right to honor the victorious warriors on this holy day? Today we should openly speak about the fact that during the Great Patriotic War Belarusian civilian population was subjected to a massive and systemic extermination. We will never forget that millions of our compatriots fell on battlefields, perished in death camps, were hanged, shot or tortured to death by gestapo. We remember it and if someone forgets it, we will remind them,\u201d the Belarusian president said in 2021.\n\nWhom does the memory of the victims and heroes of the war give hard time today?\n\n\u201cThe memory of the victims of the war, the heroism of our fathers and grandfathers gives a hard time to some people, first of all, to the ideological followers of murderers and traitors. It is they who honor the executioners in their parliaments today. It was they who started the war against graves and monuments in Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine. Complete madmen! Do they think that by destroying a monument they will destroy the memory that lives in the hearts of the people? The people who found the strength to build new peaceful relations with those states that only yesterday brought suffering and death to our lands,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko said as he attended a ceremony together with Russian President Vladimir Putin to unveil the memorial to the USSR civilians who fell victim of Nazi genocide during Great Patriotic War in January 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this great monument bear importance for our peoples? After all, there are thousands of war monuments in Russia and Belarus. Everything is simple. The overwhelming majority of them honor the heroes - Red Army soldiers and partisans, the people who defended their land with weapons in their hands. It is as important to pay tribute to the people who could not defend themselves.\n\n\u201cThe Prosecutor General's Office of Belarus nominated Brest Fortress for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List as a memorial symbolizing the fight against Nazism, the fight against the policy of genocide throughout the world. The Prosecutor General's Office also suggested awarding the international status of historical and cultural heritage to the Trostenets concentration camp, which was the largest one in terms of the number of people killed there. Large-scale work is conducted to set up expositions dedicated to the genocide of the Belarusian people in all corners of our country. Together with the Education Ministry we have prepared supplements about the genocide of the Belarusian people to the history textbooks,\u201d representative of the General Prosecutor's Office Sergei Shikunets said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war\u201d\n\nAgain we may ask a rhetorical question: why our European neighbors are deeply preoccupied with demolishing Soviet memorials? Why do Belarus and Russia try their best to perpetuate the memory of that terrible tragedy? A common tragedy for all our peoples.\n\nDuring that ceremony Aleksandr Lukashenko reminded us of a simple truth: we cannot change the past, but it is in our power to protect the future. For this, we should cherish our common historical memory, the brotherhood of peoples and the unbreakable unity of the nations that fought against the world evil and defeated it. At a time when some forces prefer to forget the terrible pages of the Second World War, try to shift the accents in terms of responsibility of some countries, Belarus stands guards of the true history. Not only in stone. Back in October 2004 Aleksandr Lukashenko signed a decree to establish a new insignia - a pennant \u2018For valor and perseverance during the Great Patriotic War\u2019. It was awarded to 36 settlements of Belarus. Each of these places became a true citadel of fortitude, where both soldiers and local residents showed incredible bravery.\n\n\u201cAs long as we build monuments, as long as we come to the monuments, we will not go to war, we will avoid such terrible tragedies. As soon as we forget the way to these holy places, a war will certainly follow,\u201d the Belarusian leader warned.\n\nIs it possible to forgive the Nazis\u2019 crimes?\n\nThanks to search operations, many horrifying facts have been uncovered and new evidence of terrible crimes has been discovered over the past three years.\n\n\u201cThe German fascist invaders and their accomplices spared no one: either children, or the elderly, or women. In this exhibit we see fragments of shoes found at the excavation site in Ivanovshchina Forest in Logoisk District, Minsk Oblast. In that pit of about 80 meters in diameter we found bone remains belonging to at least 1,021 people. The most horrifying thing is that we found skeletal remains of children and women. We had to remove the bone remains with our own hands. It was really hard to do this emotionally because we understood we were touching history. It was hard to imagine what happened in that place 80 years ago: people waiting for their death near the pit. People were brought to the edge of the pit, forced to their knees and shot dead. Those who were wounded were simply buried alive,\u201d Sergei Shikunets said.\n\nThousands of concentration camp prisoners have shared their memories. Their stories leave no one indifferent. We would like to tell you about the fate of one girl - Emilia Kopytok. She, a 10-year-old red-haired girl then, called Squirrel by her loving parents, went through six concentration camps. And she survived! The child saw baths with human fat from which soap was made, saw little children and their mothers brutally murdered. Is it possible to forgive such things? Is it possible to forget?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we were allowed to get off carriages, I saw a forest, German guards and German shepherd dogs. And a huge bonfire. Nearby there was another train full of Jews. The Jews were also getting off train, and mothers were carrying small children in their arms. They were all very pretty and curly-haired. These children were grabbed and thrown into the bonfire. The mothers who ran after their children screaming were bayoneted and thrown into the fire too. There was terrible screaming, terrible howling, terrible crying, terrible barking of dogs. The bonfire was burning like a candle,\u201d Emilia Kopytok said.\n\nBelarusians are a strong nation. Strong because they never forget. Strong because they are ready to forgive. But is it really a time to forgive?",

Although it was after the Second World War that we managed to wrest from each other this commitment to never fight again, effectively putting an end to the killing of millions that had been going on for centuries in Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe Austrian chancellor stressed that everyone must be vigilant when someone is trying to pass off a criminal as victim in Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\n\"We must be vigilant when we think and talk about defensive democracy and defense, so as not to allow the criminal to become a victim as radicals sometimes try to do as regards Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" Nehammer emphasized.\n\nAccording to the chancellor, it is also necessary to be vigilant in the matter of a terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel.

I come to listen and to learn first,\" Moroz told Fox News Digital. \"If I can model a faith that is curious and humble, as well as courageous \u2014 that\u2019s what I want these chaplains to bring to the soldiers they serve.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Moroz to learn more about the very recent creation of Ukraine's chaplaincy corps, how its clerics and faith leaders operate, and the challenges they face alongside normal combatants.\n\nUKRAINE BUSTS UP RUSSIA'S ZELENSKYY ASSASSINATION PLOT IN MASSIVE 'FAILURE' OF PUTIN'S SPIES\n\nChaplains in the Ukrainian conflict are divided into two groups \u2014 enlisted soldiers and volunteers supported by churches or regional dioceses.\n\nThe Military Chaplaincy Service is a brand-new structure within the Ukrainian armed forces, introduced in 2022 by an act of the nation's parliament. Prior to its introduction, the only spiritual support provided to soldiers was auxiliary programs run independently by churches.\n\nTraining for chaplains inside and outside the armed forces is disorganized and lacks standardization. Many are forced to learn on the job and pick up pastoral skills as they go.\n\nUkraine is an overwhelmingly Christian country with a solid Eastern Orthodox majority, followed by a smaller contingency of Catholics, and an even smaller Protestant minority.\n\nSergii Dadsko \u2014 a chaplain who began volunteering in 2014 working with civilian refugees \u2014 now puts most of his effort into serving soldiers. He studied at a seminary before the invasion, but says most of his training has been through his wartime ministry.\n\nRUSSIA'S KREMLIN PARADES WESTERN EQUIPMENT CAPTURES FROM UKRAINIAN ARMY AT EXHIBITION\n\nMykhailo Hryhoruk is a member of Olive Branch, an organization coordinating religious support for years across Ukraine. Olive Branch has given Mykhailo opportunities to take courses and attend seminary classes in Kyiv and Ryvne.\n\nThe pair work together, often coordinating relief for soldiers coming out of combat to resupply or due to injuries. The chaplains help soldiers find showers and a place to rest. They serve all members of the military, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.\n\nIn between the logistical work of caring for the wounded and exhausted, they find time to read Scripture and invite others to join them.\n\nThe work is crucial, Moroz says, as Ukrainian society continues suffering an overwhelming mental toll in the face of massive casualties.\n\n\"In the midst of trauma and conflict, I have personally experienced both individuals who are finding their faith and actively expressing it, and individuals who are experiencing a crisis of faith,\" Moroz told Fox News Digital. \"I would say the longer this war goes, the more I see discouragement and hardening of hearts. I heard one of the volunteers say this week, trauma will either drown you (harden you) or it will teach you how to float (it will tenderize your heart).\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMoroz, through his Renewal Initiative program, is one of many foreign faith leaders entering Ukraine in order to support those aiding the soldiers.\n\n\"I just finished a three-day retreat on a beautiful (and peaceful) camp property outside of Kyiv. We had between 80\u2013100 chaplains and civilian volunteers that have been actively serving others during the last two years (some longer - since 2014),\" Moroz said. \"I brought four mental health specialists with me and three other pastors. We had self-care/self-assessment sessions based around physical, emotional, and spiritual care. Outside of the sessions, the guests set counseling appointments with the therapists.\"\n\nHe continued, \"With the help of donors from the United States, we were able to purchase delicious and wholesome food, hire massage therapists, and provide a sauna experience. There were also moments of prayer for personal health and the country of Ukraine. We were told that this is something that is desperately needed in Ukraine and does not exist broadly.\"\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is now in its second year.

        "content": "Since the beginning of the New Year, Russia has embarked on a massive onslaught targeting Ukrainian cities on a par with its bombing blitz at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. This offensive assault was not surprising as Russia was believed to be purposely accumulating missiles and drones in the final several months of 2023. However, the source of some of the missiles used in Russia\u2019s most recent bombing missions has touched off some serious consternation in Ukraine and in Western capitals.\n\nIn reaction to these latest barrages of bombs, the White House claimed that Russia had used North Korean ballistic missiles to strike Ukraine. This announcement was later verified by senior Ukrainian officials. On Jan. 9, 2024, the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, the European Union and some 40 additional partner countries denounced North Korea\u2019s export of ballistic missiles for Russian use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transport of North Korean missiles is the latest expansion of the country\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s military aggression toward Ukraine. The first reports of North Korean arms shipments to Russia came out back in late 2022. A year later, in October 2023, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby revealed that North Korea had delivered over 1,000 canisters of weaponry and equipment to Russia. In late 2023, South Korean officials maintained North Korean military factories were operating at full force in an attempt to meet Russian demand for arms.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Russia Leadership Shakeup The new MinDef Belousov, is a technocrat without Defense experience, but nevertheless a competent and trusted manager, the author writes.\n\nIt is not known what Russia is trading in exchange for North Korean weapons, although rumors claim the Kremlin is providing the sanctioned nation with access to newly developed military technologies. It has been reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited several military sites displaying advanced military systems during a September 2023 trip to Russia.\n\nUnfortunately, North Korea has been joined in stocking Vladimir Putin with an arsenal for attacking Ukraine by a second autocratic regime. Iran has furnished Russia with vast numbers of attack drones and artillery shells with Russia also gaining use of Iran\u2019s drone technologies to institute extensive domestic production of attack drones to utilize against Ukraine. Reports in the New Year show this collaboration is strengthening with Russia set to receive upgraded drones along with Iranian ballistic missiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian war effort two years into its invasion of Ukraine has come to be dependent on the military backing it is getting from North Korea and Iran. Whereas Putin has transferred much of Russia\u2019s economy into war mode, the duration and vigor of the fighting in Ukraine demonstrates that Moscow is presently not able to meet the high demand for specific munitions classes like drones, missiles and artillery shells.\n\nCurrently in year three of the full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, North Korea and Iran\u2019s ammunition deliveries are allowing Russia to preserve a notable heavy weapons advantage in a battle now described as a war of attrition. Additionally, the constant supply of Iranian drones allows Russia to pursue its intense bombing crusade against Ukrainian cities and the country\u2019s civilian infrastructure. Ballistic missiles obtained from North Korea and Iran will permit Russia to continue expanding the air war against Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Putin\u2019s fellow cohorts in Pyongyang and Tehran become braver in their willingness to subsidize Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, the West\u2019s group allegiance to the Ukrainian side has become questionable. In the US, the recently passed aid package for Ukraine saw a six-month delay thanks to domestic political haggling. This development is raising questions about the future of the West\u2019s support for Ukraine in a drawn-out conflict with Russia.\n\nRecent indicators of Western frailty are encouraging to Putin, who believes he can withstand Ukraine\u2019s Western allies in a test of political fortitude. His historical endgame of invading Ukraine has always been a venture to put an end to Western dominance and initiate a new world order. Forming alliances with congenial autocratic regimes is a major step toward achieving such a goal.\n\nThere is little doubt that Russia has successfully instituted a partnership in arms together with North Korea and Iran. The three autocratic countries are capitalizing on their military capability and manufacturing large quantities of weapons required to thwart resistance from the West and attain a Russian victory in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis union of authoritarians constitutes a severe threat to the future of the world\u2019s security. Should Russia triumph in Ukraine with the help of military backing from North Korea and Iran, Ukrainians will not be the only victims. A Putin victory could set off a catastrophic paradigm. The global community could easily be confronted by more wars of aggression, with the world plunging into a perilous new age where today\u2019s regulations with regard to national sovereignty and territorial integrity would no longer be applicable.\n\nThis is not yet a reality, but time is of the essence. To avoid decades of international apprehension and uncertainty, Western leaders have to send an unequivocal message to all autocrats and Putin copycats by ensuring Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine culminates in a momentous defeat.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are the author\u2019s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.",

        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nOn Tuesday, Vladimir Putin was inaugurated for another six-year term as president amid the worst crisis in Moscow\u2019s relations with the West over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. During the traditionally ornate ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin called his compatriots a \"united and great nation\" and vowed to place Russia\u2019s interests and security above anything else. Brimming with confidence, the Russian strongman punctuated his speech by declaring: \"Together we will overcome all obstacles. We will fulfill everything we have planned. Together we will win.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the top U.S. spy chief, DNI Avril Haines, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the Russia-Ukraine war is \"unlikely to end anytime soon,\" warning that Putin\u2019s \"aggressive tactics are likely to continue.\" That, despite the fact that Congress recently approved another multibillion-dollar military aid package for Ukraine to help it fight the Russians.\n\nWhat is inside Putin\u2019s mind at this time? Will the Russian dictator be deterred by our government\u2019s unwavering commitment to fund Kyiv? What are his next steps?\n\nAS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN SOVIET RUSSIA, DON'T LET AMERICA TURN INTO A GODLESS NATION\n\nHaving examined Russia\u2019s force posture, the state of the Russian military and economy, declared strategic goals and threat perceptions, here is what we can expect from Putin, whose thinking I\u2019ve studied and analyzed in the course of my intelligence career. I will also note what Putin will probably not do.\n\nFirst, the Russian forces will highly likely initiate a major counteroffensive campaign in northeastern Ukraine. It's possible that it could begin right after the Victory Day Parade, the national holiday celebrating Russia\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Aiming to capitalize on Ukraine\u2019s shortages in manpower, combat hardware and ammunition, the Russians will seek to break through the front lines by or during this summer.\n\nTo make this happen, Moscow is preparing 100,000 troops to join the front lines, consistent with the decree signed by Putin in December directing the Ministry of Defense to increase the armed forces by 170,000 additional personnel to the maximum strength of 1,320,000 servicemen. Moscow is also increasing its defense spending by almost 70% in 2024 from 2023.\n\nPutin feels that the momentum is on Russia\u2019s side theater wide, as Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned. This being said, he is almost certainly deeply concerned about a recent statement made by French President Emmanuel Macron to The Economist. Macron insinuated that he would send troops to Ukraine \"if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request.\"\n\nAiming to deter NATO from deploying forces into the theater, Russia will hold military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons. Putin personally ordered the drills to \"practice for the preparation and deployment for use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" according to Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense.\n\nWhile Russia routinely conducts strategic nuclear exercises, announcing them in advance, the public declaration made by Moscow of non-strategic nuclear drills is unprecedented. It is intended as a strategic signaling to leaders in Washington and NATO commanders to stay out of what Russia considers its strategic security perimeter, of which Ukraine is part in Moscow\u2019s view.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s inauguration speech, Putin \u2013 almost certainly referring to Ukrainians living in the regions annexed by Moscow \u2013 thanked the \"citizens of Russia in all regions of our country, residents of our historical lands who defended the right to be together with the Motherland.\" Putin believes that Russia has a rightful claim to Ukraine its statehood originated from \"Kievan Rus,\" the land that is currently occupied by modern Ukraine.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of Russians support the actions of its military in Ukraine, effectively agreeing with Putin, according to the Levada Center. The same percentage of Russians believe that Russia will win the war. Levada is an independent polling agency designated by the Russian state as a \"foreign agent\" for expressing views that are unfavorable to the Russian government.\n\nIS RUSSIA\u2019S PUTIN A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN OR HAS HE WEAPONIZED RELIGION TO ADVANCE HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS?\n\nSecond, Russian intelligence services will likely ramp up their hunt for Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an attempt to assassinate him. On Saturday, the Russian government added Zelenskyy to the list of wanted criminals. The Russian Interior Ministry justified the search warrant for the Ukrainian president by stating that is \"under an article of the criminal code.\"\n\nZelenskyy has been on the target list since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022 and has survived multiple assassination attempts. A day before Putin\u2019s inauguration, Ukraine\u2019s counterintelligence services reportedly disrupted a Russian covert operation aimed at infiltrating Zelenskyy\u2019s security team and taking him hostage or killing him.\n\nRussia has a targeted assassination program governed by the federal law, \"On Countering Extreme Activity,\" that was approved by Putin in 2002, two-and-a-half years after he assumed the presidency, and updated in 2006. This law already allows Russian intelligence services to \"eliminate (likvidirovat) Zelenskyy and other military and political leaders of Ukraine as \u2018persons presenting a threat to the Russian state.\u2019\"\n\nPlacing Zelenskyy on the \"wanted list\" sends a signal to Russian security services that capturing or killing him is a priority for the Kremlin.\n\nThe Russians will likely intensify their efforts to eliminate Zelenskyy on or after May 20, the day when his presidential term officially ends. Last November, Zelenskyy canceled the 2024 presidential election, arguing that Ukraine must concentrate all its resources on fighting Russia, which prompted Moscow to consider him illegitimate as the leader of Ukraine.\n\nThird, Russia will intensify its non-kinetic confrontation with Washington. While Russia fears a direct war with the U.S. and NATO, because of our superiority in conventional arms, it views the risk of the erosion of its strategic buffer zone, on which it relied for its security for centuries, even more. Washington\u2019s continuous support provided to Ukraine has exacerbated Russia\u2019s fears of a future conflict with NATO.\n\nMoscow believes a direct kinetic U.S.-Russia war is \"inevitable\" in the long run. The Russian General Staff made this intelligence assessment based on the long-standing U.S. policy seeking to democratize Russia\u2019s post-Soviet neighbors in Eurasia and Washington\u2019s stated intentions to accept Ukraine into NATO, an adversarial alliance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLast week, four Russian military aircraft breached the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), but didn\u2019t enter U.S. airspace, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Russia periodically flies strategic bombers close to our borders. These practice runs are intended to test our responses and to signal the readiness of the Russian military for a full-on war with the United States over control of the post-Soviet regions. Russian weapons systems are already capable of striking targets throughout the United States and Canada from stand-off distances \u2013 that is, without entering U.S. sovereign airspace to deliver the weapons.\n\nRussian intelligence services also will likely intensify their efforts to arrest U.S. citizens traveling to Russia in a effort to rattle the Biden administration and to accumulate a list of candidates to trade with Washington for high-value Russian operatives held in U.S. prisons. On Tuesday, a U.S. Army soldier was detained in Vladivostok on charges of theft. Having had a number of prisoner swaps that Putin almost certainly feels were favorable to Russia, Moscow likely concluded that it can manipulate the Biden administration into giving up Russian assets valuable to Putin.\n\nFinally, what Putin will not do is invade a NATO nation. Despite such claims made by Washington politicians, such a move would be suicidal for Putin as it would trigger NATO Article 5 Collective Defense. Putin is acutely aware of Russia\u2019s conventional inferiority visa-a-vis NATO.\n\nPutin routinely uses Russia\u2019s nuclear trump card to intimidate the West and would likely authorize a tactical nuclear strike in the theater such as in Ukraine in certain scenarios, but those are high on the escalation ladder. But, as a rational actor, he would not intentionally pick a fight in which Russia would face the might of NATO\u2019s entire war-fighting machine. Such a claim is illogical. It is also refuted by multiple assessments made by the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe 2024 Annual Threat assessment reveals that \"Russia almost certainly does not want a direct military conflict with U.S. and NATO forces and will continue asymmetric activity below what it calculates to be the threshold of military conflict globally.\"\n\nThe following excerpts from unclassified intelligence reports debunk the idea that Russia has the military and economic capacity to invade a NATO country, triggering a war with NATO: \"Russia has suffered more military losses than at any time since World War II \u2013 roughly 300,000 casualties and thousands of tanks and armored combat vehicles\" and \"Moscow's military forces will face a multi-year recovery after suffering extensive equipment and personnel losses during the Ukraine conflict.\"\n\nThe same report reveals that \"the Russian military has and will continue to face issues of attrition, personnel shortages, and morale challenges.\"",
