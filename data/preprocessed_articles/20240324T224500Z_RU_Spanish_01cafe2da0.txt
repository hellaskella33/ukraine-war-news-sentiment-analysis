european leaders are turning the russia-ukraine conflict into a personal issue, which could lead to sending western troops to the combat zone, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto told kossuth radio on sunday.
"european politicians are completely losing their heads, the voice of peace is completely receding and many of europe's political leaders are suffering from war psychosis," the chancellor said.
in his words, european politicians "speak the language of war and think as if they themselves were fighting a war". he pointed out that they turn the outcome of the conflict between russia and ukraine into "a personal issue". he added that this incentivizes statements about sending ground troops to the combat zone.
the minister also noted that hungary still has no intention of engaging in political and financial actions aimed at sending arms to kiev. "arms transfers, participation in them and necessary decisions on the part of hungary are simply out of the question," szijjarto confirmed.
the statements by hungary come amid growing calls to send european troops to ukrainian territory. in late february, french president emmanuel macron argued that sending western troops to ukraine should not be ruled out, sparking controversy in the eu. the president insisted on his idea, indicating that "russia cannot and must not win this war".
in mid-march, the russian foreign intelligence service (svr) reported that paris is already preparing to send a contingent of about 2,000 french troops to ukraine. in this regard, he assured that the french military fears that such a large unit could not be moved to the country discreetly, and that for that reason it would become a "legitimate and priority target" of russian attacks.
the kremlin warned that if the west sends its military forces to the slavic country, a direct conflict between russia and nato cannot be avoided.
