kyiv — russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on ukrainian cities early friday that destroyed energy infrastructure, caused power blackouts in different regions and killed several people — highlighting the country’s urgent need for stronger air defenses outside kyiv.
the strikes, which hit ukraine’s largest hydroelectric power plant in the southeastern city of zaporizhzhia, amounted to “the largest attack on the ukrainian energy sector in recent times,” ukrainian energy minister german galushchenko said.
