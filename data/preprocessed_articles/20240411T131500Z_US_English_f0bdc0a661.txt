paris — ukrainian athletes who have died during russia’s invasion have been killed like so many of their countrymen. at home. at work. on the front lines.

some weren’t even fully formed athletes at all. alina peregudova, skinny, just 14 years old, was already an olympic weightlifting prospect when she died in 2022 along with her mother in russia’s bombardment of mariupol.
