it turns out that in the country of wooden churches and russian-style ‘terems’ (fairytale houses), there are more than 2,000 buildings built in a seemingly “alien” european style, the gothic.

1. the kaliningrad cathedral

in kaliningrad region, original medieval gothic churches, rather than the neo-gothic stylizations built later, have been preserved. this is because, before world war ii, it was the territory of germany and prussia. one of them is the königsberg (as the city used to be called) cathedral, which opened its doors in 1380.



2. tsaritsyno palace in moscow

this palace ensemble for german-born empress catherine the great was designed in the late 18th century by court architect vasily bazhenov. she wanted it to be built in the "gothic taste". however, for various reasons, the construction wasn't completed. at the turn of the 21st century the palace was restored and now houses an exhibition complex.

3. the chesme church in st. petersburg

nicholas i, the grandson of catherine the great, was a great germanophile, not only because of his grandmother, but also because of his wife, a german princess. he ordered the construction of a house church in the alexandria park in peterhof. the chapel resembles a miniature gothic cathedral and is consecrated in honor of st. alexander nevsky.

5. vladimir church in bykovo, moscow region

this church was built in the early 19th century in the ancient mozhaisk kremlin near moscow. architect alexei bakarev combined the typical russian church structure with gothic decorative elements so successfully that he was commissioned to rebuild the moscow kremlin’s nikolskaya tower in the gothic style.

all the moscow kremlin towers were built by italian architects in the late 15th century, but then, some of them underwent significant changes. for example, in the 1620s, english architect christopher galoway added a tiered gothic top over the spasskaya tower. in the early 19th century, the nikolskaya tower was completely rebuilt in the gothic style by swiss architect luigi ruska and the aforementioned russian alexei bakarev.
