venezuelan president nicolas maduro on tuesday described the ukrainian conflict as "an immoral war" unleashed by washington and its allies against moscow.
"in ukraine they consummated a coup d'Ã©tat to go about positioning the war against russia," the president declared. "they [the west] were shaping that scenario of war against russia"; however, moscow "has resisted" western pressure, he stressed.
"today russia is stronger on the economic level. today russia is winning the war in the military field, it is defeating the entire west in the military field," maduro affirmed.
according to his words, the west and nato led ukraine to "an immoral war". "i am sure that president putin is in command of this situation. he already denounced that they simply do not give ukraine permission to negotiate peace," he said.
at the same time, maduro noted that, in his opinion, the conflict in ukraine has become "unsustainable" for the u.s. "this is an unsustainable war, the war of nato, of the u.s. against russia through ukraine. it is unsustainable," the venezuelan leader reiterated. "this is already taking water on all sides," he affirmed.
"it is a matter of time before russia demonstrates its historical reason, its strength, and continues to advance in a very difficult field which is the field of war," maduro concluded.
