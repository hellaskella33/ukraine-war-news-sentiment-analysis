minsk, 24 april (belta) – the usa made a mistake by uniting russia and its archenemy china, belarusian president aleksandr lukashenko said addressing the 7th belarusian people’s congress on 24 april, belta has learned.“the world has already changed. and not the way that people overseas wanted. but what do they want? what is their endgame? the united states, having launched a sweeping attack on all undesirable countries simultaneously (you know this axis of “evil”: from belarus to north korea, including russia, china, iran and others), they realized that they made a mistake as they brought together the disobedient russia and their main enemy china. by exerting pressure, they pushed these two states together: russia with extensive resources and a powerful defense industry and china with enormous economic and human potential. they realized that they could not handle this union,” aleksandr lukashenko said.the president said that he is keeping tabs on these issues, since he had to discuss them with senior american officials five years ago.but the united states found a way out: they instigated a conflict in europe, in ukraine, and put it on the shoulders of the european union and nato, promising to help with money.“the goal is to distract, get russia bogged down in the war with ukraine, weaken it with the war and sanctions (as russia will be too busy to build an alliance with china). and meanwhile, they wanted to deal with china, and drag others whenever possible into this showdown: aukus [defense alliance of australia, the united kingdom and the united states], which is a new nato in the pacific, and then japan and south korea. this is the essence of the u.s. strategy to assert its dominance in the world. after that everything will be over: they will throw everyone under the bus, like they did in afghanistan.”
