the us senate is poised to vote on tuesday, april 23, on a significant aid package for ukraine. following months of debate, the house of representatives approved the assistance with broad bipartisan support, making the passage in the senate almost certain.

senate majority leader chuck schumer announced on saturday, "the finish line is now in sight" for the assistance package. he confirmed that an agreement had been "locked in" for a vote on tuesday.

"the task before us is urgent. it is once again the senate's turn to make history," said senate minority leader mitch mcconnell.

the final package, totaling $95 billion in military assistance to us allies, includes funds for israel and taiwan, alongside the $61 billion earmarked for ukraine. president joe biden is expected to receive the bill for approval by the end of the week.

unlike the complicated negotiations in the republican-controlled house, the senate vote is anticipated to proceed more smoothly.

president biden assured ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky in a monday phone call that the assistance would arrive "quickly" to aid ukraine in its ongoing battle against russia's invasion.
