kyiv — ukraine’s parliament approved legislation thursday that officials say will simplify conscription, aiding an expected mobilization that could press hundreds of thousands of ukrainian men into the fight against russia’s invasion.

as western aid has slowed, including a $60 billion u.s. package stalled in congress for six months, ukraine’s armed forces have been struggling with a severe shortage of soldiers, ammunition and weapons — allowing russia to advance on the battlefield.
