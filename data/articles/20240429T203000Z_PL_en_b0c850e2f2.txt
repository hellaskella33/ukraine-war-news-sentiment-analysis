Aleksander Kwasniewski about the threats before which the European Union will face

During the speech, the former president said, among othersabout the threats that the European Union can face.- Today, in the face of the future of the EU, I see the following threats - Russian aggression to Ukraine, this is what affects us the most and which the consequences can be dramatic.This war, if we help Ukraine, will last a long time, but at least it will not end with Putin's victory.His victory means the vassalization of Ukraine, Russian influence on the Bug and the continuation of this reconstruction of great Russia, i.e. Moldova, the Caucasus, and central Asia.This is a real risk and a fact that requires us to act - said Kwasniewski.

According to the former president, the second threat is the "unclear situation before the upcoming American elections, Donald Trump's victory and a change in American policy, also in relation to the EU and NATO."- In short, the weakening of the transatlantic bond, in the context of the threat of Russian aggression, would be terrible news.The third threat is China, which, for now, behave restrained.But we don't know what will happen next, and the degree of Europe's dependence on China is colossal.So here the conflict or tension can be very difficult for Europe - noted Kwasniewski.

According to the former president, the next important challenge is the internal threat and "the most serious".- It is an increase in aggression and also the strength of support of anti -European, populist and nationalist parties and environments.Europe can prevent a terrible fate if this way of thinking, anti -European, selfish, nationalist will increase strength.Hence the importance of these European elections.Hence the appeal also on my part to conduct a strong campaign.I believe that the left will do it so that the turnout is high.Indeed, these are not elections about who will be comfortable in the Parliament, these are elections to "be or not to be" European integration in the future - continued Kwasniewski.

Aleksander Kwasniewski about Poland's accession to the European Union

During the speech, the former president also commented on joining Poland to the European Union.- It's not like we've come to the club of happy people forever ever and now we can pay in this joy and stress -free life and nothing awaits us.What gave us the 21st century is a whole sequence of difficult events, more difficult, and finally tragic - said Aleksander Kwasniewski.

Aleksander Kwasniewski also put the thesis that "this is a great extension of the European Union in 2004 is the last huge historic, optimistic decision that we experienced in this 21st century."- The Union must be reformed, you have to change (...).Societies change, people's expectations are different (...) It is important not to lose this value in these changes, which is European integration, which is our community activity, as well as our use of Europe's potential in this changing geopolitical architecture of the world- said Kwasniewski.

- The Union will change and must change and must have a strong, rational voice of Poland - pro -European, not naive (...).We made the right decision at the right time.We were not late for the history of history, if we did not do it in 2004, we would not be in the EU to this day.We were smart on time - the politician concluded.
