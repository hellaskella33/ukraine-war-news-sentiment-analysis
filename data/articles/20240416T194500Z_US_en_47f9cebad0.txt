Paris, France (CNN)-A French official confirmed to CNN, on Tuesday, that France will not invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to commemorate the eighty anniversary of the Normandy D-Day landing in France, due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The organizing body of the celebrations, noting that the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is the reason behind not inviting Putin.

Putin attended the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of Normandy, but he was not invited to attend the seventy -fifth anniversary in 2019, following the repercussions of the Russian invasion of the Crimea and East Ukraine Island in 2014.

Last year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian President, on charges of deporting Ukrainian children.

Historically, the leaders of the countries whose forces participated in the landing of the Normandy were invited to attend the main annual occasions of the 1944 conquest, and the invitation was also invited to Russia due to the main role played by the former Soviet Union in World War II.

Du Vegetu said that Russia would be invited to send an actor, but the actor will not be Putin, "in order to honor the commitment and sacrifices of the Soviet peoples, as well as its contribution to victory in 1945."

After Putin was not invited in 2019, the Kremlin questioned the importance of the day of landing, to secure victory over Nazi Germany.

"In contrast to the Kremlin regime, France does not pursue the policy of historical distortion," said Du Vegetu.
