Russian military equipment captured by the Ukrainian armed forces has gone on display in the Czech capital, Prague.

The display of war trophies, which includes a damaged T-90 tank, Buk air defence system and Msta howitzer, was unveiled on Letna Plain, a large open space a short distance from Prague Castle.

"This exhibition proves how vital support from partner countries is to us," Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrsky told the BBC via email after launching the exhibit.

"Russian propaganda likes to scare people that their tanks could reach Prague, Berlin or Paris. Ukrainians demonstrate - only in the form of scrap," he said.
