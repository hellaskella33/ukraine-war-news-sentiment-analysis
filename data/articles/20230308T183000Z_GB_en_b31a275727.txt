China’s top military minds have been paying close attention to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, watching the war’s every turn as Beijing continues to develop its armed forces.

Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, has vowed to take over Taiwan as part of his ambitious plan for “national rejuvenation” even if it means using military force – a move that could lead to a war with the United States, which has promised to defend the island nation from invasion.

While the Chinese military is the world’s largest, with more than two million soldiers serving in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), it remains largely untested – its last major war was a failed invasion of Vietnam in 1979 that lasted less than four weeks.

Under Mr Xi, however, the PLA has undergone dramatic modernisation, in recent years testing hypersonic missiles and conducting increasingly complex military drills in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, corners of the world that Beijing claims as its own territory.

So rapid is the pace of China’s military modernisation, in fact, that US military officials have warned that China could soon surpass the US in some areas, including even in naval power – an area where Washington has been unchallenged since the Second World War.
