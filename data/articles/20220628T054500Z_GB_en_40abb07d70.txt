The head of the British Army has likened the country's current defence situation in the wake of Russia's "brutal aggression" to the lead up to the Second World War, warning Britain is facing its "1937 moment".

In an address on Tuesday, Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Patrick Sanders, is set to say that Britain's armed forces must be prepared to "fight and win" to prevent the war from expanding across Europe.

It comes as Russia's relentless invasion of Ukraine becomes deadlier by the day, with Vladimir Putin posing one of the largest threats to peace and democracy ever known.

Here is what the Army chief's comments mean.

What happened in 1937?

Neville Chamberlain became Britain's prime minister on May 28, 1937 and on the brink of the Second World War, pursued a policy of appeasement in a bid to prevent Adolf Hitler from dragging Europe into another world war.

Mr Chamberlain hoped to prevent war at all costs.

"I am myself a man of peace to the depths of my soul," he said, in an excerpt of his 1938 speech.

"Armed conflict between nations is a nightmare to me ... For the present I ask you to await as calmly as you can the events of the next few days. As long as war has not begun, there is always hope that it may be prevented."
