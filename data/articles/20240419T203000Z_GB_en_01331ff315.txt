Speaking after the Nato-Ukraine Council summit held by video link, Mr Stoltenberg said: "Nato defence ministers have agreed to step up and provide further military support, including more air defence."

He said the 32-member bloc "has mapped out existing capabilities across the alliance and there are systems that can be made available to Ukraine".

"So I expect new announcements on air defence capabilities for Ukraine soon," he added.

The Nato chief said there were Patriot and other advanced air defence systems available in stocks of Nato countries that could be given to Ukraine - but he gave no details about what exactly Kyiv might get.

Last week, Germany pledged to supply Kyiv with a third US-made Patriot battery out of its military stocks.

Ukraine currently has several Patriot systems, but not enough to defend its cities from massive Russian attacks.
