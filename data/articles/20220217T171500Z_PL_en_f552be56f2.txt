The head of American diplomacy Antony Blinken during the Thursday meeting of the United Nations Security Council warned that "Russia had already taken steps towards the war, trying to create an excuse for invasion."On the other hand, the deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia Sergei Wierzynin accused the authorities in Kiev of the fact that "they do not implement the Minsk agreements regarding the regulation of the armed conflict in Donbas."

"Our information clearly indicates that forces, including land, air forces, ships, are preparing to start an attack against Ukraine on the coming days," said Antony Blinken during the UN Security Council meeting convened by Russia.

Blinken said that Russia had already taken steps towards the war, trying to create an excuse for invasion, accusing Kiev, among others, a possible chemical weapon attack, a terrorist attack on Russia's territory or for genocide.The Secretary of State of the USA pointed out that the Russian media has already begun intensifying similar accusations, including during the Thursday meeting of the Security Council.

Blinkken said that the next phase of Russia's plan would be to convene "theatrical" meetings of bodies such as the council and saying that he must defend the Russian -speaking people in Ukraine.

- Then the attack will start.Russian rockets and bombs will fall throughout Ukraine.Communication means will be turned off and cyberrataki will paralyze key Ukrainian institutions.Then Russian tanks and soldiers will go for key purposes - said the head of diplomacy.He added that the US also has information that there is Kiev on the list of Russian aggression goals, and that Russia has plans to attack against specific groups of Ukrainians.

Blinken called on Russia to clearly deny that he would attack against Ukraine, and added that he would be happy to accept criticism if the US information is not confirmed.He emphasized that if Russia refuses to deny such a denial, "the world will remember it".At the same time, he announced that the US wants to "give diplomacy every chance for success."

Blinken's speech was an unplanned speech and, as the US ambassador to UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, was a reaction to information indicating that Russia had already taken movements towards the upcoming invasion.

The allegation of a Russian diplomat

The deputy head of Russian diplomacy Sergei Wierzynin during the speech argued that Kiev "did not implement" Minsk agreements regarding the regulation of the armed conflict in Donbas.He reminded that the Ukrainian authorities did not fulfill the findings of the status of Donbass.

- The source of the problem is the systematic reluctance of Kiev to establish a direct dialogue with the authorized representatives of Donetsk and Lugansk in the contact group - said Wierszynin, quoted by the Russian agency Ria Nowosti.

The deputy minister of foreign affairs accused the authorities in Kiev that "they took the course to completely reject direct cooperation with the republics in Donbas."

Wierszynin also quoted alleged cases of Ukrainian crimes against civilians in Donbas.He also stated that he was "disappointed" by the attitude of Western countries and a lack of pressure on Ukraine to implement decisions from Minsk.He turned to Western countries that they would "not repeat unfounded accusations that the Russian Federation is planning to attack Ukraine."

- It seems to me that there was already enough speculation on this subject, including at the UN Security Council meeting, convened by the United States on January 31.We have explained a long time ago and found everything required.The announced date of the alleged invasion has already passed, so there is nothing to appear in an awkward situation - he added.
