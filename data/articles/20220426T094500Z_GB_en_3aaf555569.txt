It would be acceptable for Ukrainian forces to use Western weapons to attack military targets on Russian soil, a UK defence minister has said.

James Heappey said strikes on supply lines were a "legitimate" part of war.

The UK announced it will give Ukraine a small number of anti-aircraft vehicles.

Russia's defence ministry has accused the UK of "provoking" Ukraine into attacking Russian territory, while foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Nato is engaging in a proxy war.

Mr Lavrov also said weapons delivered by the West to Ukraine would be fair targets.

Western countries have donated hundreds of millions of pounds of military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion back in February and Nato and European Union officials are meeting in Germany to discuss further military assistance.

It comes as Russia has focused its forces on the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, with the UK's Ministry of Defence reporting the city of Kreminna, in Luhansk, has fallen.

Russia has accused Ukraine of attacking targets within its territory, including an oil depot in Belgorod, but Ukrainian forces have not confirmed any strikes.
