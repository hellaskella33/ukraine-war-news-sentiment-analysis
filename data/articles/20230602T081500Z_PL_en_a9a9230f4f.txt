Asked why Serbia still did not impose sanctions on Russia, he replied that "there are some differences that result from our experiences from 25 years ago".It is about NATO's intervention in former Yugoslavia in the late 90s, which the Kremlin was strongly opposed at the time.

To this day, Russia has not supported the Kosovo Independence announced in 2008, which broke away from Serbia, which allowed her to obtain the sympathy of the authorities in Belgrade.The Kremlin is guarding its own interests, and treats the Balkans as a competition area for the zone of influence from the USA and the EU.It is also a key region of trails of supply of energy raw materials to Europe.

Vucii admitted that he had not talked to Vladimir Putin for over a year.- But I met with many leaders of the European Union countries who talked to him.I think talking to someone is not negative.However, I do not do it (he does not talk to Putin - ed.), Because they could say (West - ed.): "Look at the Serbs. They allow themselves what they want to prohibit us."

Vuciu studied Russian to talk to Putin

The Serbian leader does not hide that he knows Putin well.In previous years he had dozens of meetings with him and even took Russian language lessons to be able to talk to him freely.Their relations were changed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

- I would like to see both of them, Zelanski and Putin - as soon as possible - sitting at one table.It's always better than waging war - he emphasized.

In his opinion, Moscow and Kiev (as well as the West with Kiev) need to "find a common denominator" until the end of the war."Concessions are necessary on both sides," said Vucić and pointed out that the room is not achieved "by unilaterally setting conditions".

The President of Serbia also said that China is becoming a "increasingly important investor" for his country and quickly added that, like Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine."Such is politics," he concluded.

Belgrade has not imposed sanctions on Moscow

Serbia has been a candidate for membership in the EU for 10 years, but in September 2022 she decided to consult Moscow regarding foreign policy.This met with decisive criticism from Brussels.In addition, Belgrade has still not imposed Russia for unleashing the war in Ukraine.

Until now, Serbia was the most loyal ally of Russia in the Balkans.This is one of the countries that has not suspended flights to Russia.After Putin's invasion of Ukraine, many Russians settled in Serbia and nearby Montenegro.During the ongoing war, the Serbs also agreed with the Kremlin a new gas contract.
