MINSK, 16 February (BelTA) – No one can benefit from sanctions or a shooting war, Minister of Foreign Affairs Vladimir Makei said at a press conference on 16 February, BelTA has learned.

“I don't think that anyone will be able to reap benefits from any actions that will lead to a shooting war. I am sure that neither Moscow, nor Minsk, nor Kyiv are interested in it. Perhaps it might play into the hands of those who are very far from here,” Vladimir Makei said.

He noted that the hysteria around Russia's possible attack on Ukraine is coming from across the ocean. “Here, no one is interested in a cold war, or sanctions, or a shooting war from any point of view. Moreover, we, as a state that is located along the geopolitical boundary between East and West, will bear the brunt of this kind of actions. The Belarusian authorities, personally President Lukashenko, strongly opposed any actions that could lead to tension between our country and the neighboring states, as well as between other states,” the minister said.

“We have never said that we wanted to fight. We have always said we wanted to trade,” the foreign minister said.
