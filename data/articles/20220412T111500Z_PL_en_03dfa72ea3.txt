This is a serious challenge for all of us."In an interview with Xinhua News, this was commented by a spokesman for the Chinese ministry of diplomacy Zhao Lijian.

China: NATO disregards the facts and confuses black with white

- For some time, the head of NATO disregarded the facts and confuses black with white, casting unfounded accusations, slandering and attacking China.He gave irresponsible comments on China's foreign policy, emphasized "threat from China", and recently even used compulsion to them.China condemns and reject such behavior, and also made solemn statements in NATO many times - said Lijian.

At the same time, he accused NATO that "for a long time he was sticking to the outdated security concept, he was involved in block confrontations in accordance with the textbook of the Old Cold War and reduced to the hegemony tool of a country."- By claiming that NATO is a defensive organization, in fact it constantly causes trouble and causes confrontations.Asking other countries about compliance with basic standards regulating international relations, NATO waged war against sovereign countries and fired bullets massively, which led to the death and displacement of civilians - he said in an interview.

In the rest of the conversation Lijian went to an even more surprising opinion.

- China's development means opportunities for the world, not a threat to anyone.NATO should immediately stop distributing disinformation and provocative comments on China and abandon the confrontational approach consisting in setting ideological lines.NATO has disturbed order in Europe.He should stop trying to destabilize Asia and the whole world - said the Chinese official.

China blames NATO for the war in Ukraine

Zhao Lijian's statements are the next installment of the conflict on the NATO-China line.Last month, the deputy head of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng blamed NATO for the war in Ukraine and criticized the West for sanctions introduced against Russia - the Associated Press agency reported in mid -March.

During the conference in Beijing under the name "Red War", the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China warned that the further development of the war could cause "repercussions too terrifying to even think about them".

- Sanctions against Russia have expanded to such an extent that now globalization is served as weapons.Even athletes, culture, art or entertainment were not spared - said Yucheng.

So far, China has still not officially condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Chinese representatives and local public media, to a large extent, blame the war to the United States and the West - notes the Axios information portal.
