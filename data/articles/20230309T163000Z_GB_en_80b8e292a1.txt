Japan is bracing itself for conflict.

Although the mandarins of Kasumigaseki, the ministry district in the heart of Tokyo, will never say it out loud, pacifism is all but over 80 years after being written into the constitution.

Since its defeat in 1945, Japan has been constrained in its military spending, wary of provoking accusations that it was again developing expansionist ambitions.

From next month, however, the Japanese military will have an annual budget of ¥6.82 trillion (£43.46 billion) – an increase of more than 26 per cent over the previous year and evidence that Tokyo knows it can no longer afford to keep the gloves on.

Some want Japan to go further.

“My personal opinion is that Japan needs to possess independent nuclear weapons to deter Chinese aggression,” Fumio Ohta, a retired admiral in the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force and a former head of the Defence Intelligence Headquarters told the Telegraph.

“The lesson from Ukraine is that they gave away their nuclear weapons and they became an easy target for Russia.”

Japan is not quite ready to break that taboo.

Before December, China was “an issue of concern to the international community”. Now, in new government papers, it is described as an “unprecedented strategic challenge” to regional peace and “a threat” to security.

Much of the money will go on advanced new missiles that will give Japan an offensive strike capability again or extending the range of existing missiles designed to counter hostile ships or aircraft, such as the Type 12 Surface-to-Surface missile.

Other battle-tested systems will be purchased, such as 500 Tomahawks from the US that will give Japanese submarines the ability to attack enemy bases from which intelligence indicates an attack on Japan is imminent, while £221.16 million is being spent on the Norwegian Joint Strike Missile, air-launched cruise missile.
