But Ukrainian officials say they have seen an increase in the use of such attacks.

Oleh Synehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, told Ukrainian media that Russia has started incorporating repeat strikes on its targets "day and night".

"The occupiers are using the tactic of double-taps to hit civilian rescuers and other workers who are there first to arrive at the scene," he said.

On Thursday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said it had seen a "particularly troubling pattern" of double taps in recent weeks. It called them "cruel" and "unconscionable" and urged for them to stop.

Rescuers from Ukraine's State Emergencies Service DSNS often arrive to deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks before everyone else, and they also say the threat of repeat strikes is becoming ever more frequent.

"Unfortunately, the tactic of double-tapping has been used increasingly often recently. This is difficult to comprehend. The Russians have no right to do this," DSNS spokesman Oleksandr Khorunzhy told the BBC.

"They know perfectly well what they're doing, and not just to rescuers, police officers, utility workers or medics. This affects ordinary civilians," Mr Khorunzhy said.

He called double-taps "utterly immoral".

"I can't wrap my head around this, it's just inhuman," he said. "They see perfectly well that unarmed rescuers are the first to arrive at the sites of their attacks."

The DSNS says 91 of its rescuers have been killed and more than 340 injured since the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Kira Oves was one of the journalists injured in the Zaporizhzhia double-tap attack.

She told the BBC that she had just arrived at the scene of a strike when she heard a whistling sound.

"A colleague shouted: Incoming! On the ground!"

She crouched and heard a massive explosion. She only realised that she was wounded after she felt blood streaming down her face. She and her colleague ran to what they thought was a safe place - only to hear another "enormous blast".
