The State Department is drawing down most of its staff at the US embassy in Kyiv because Russia has a “very capable” military and the US has to prepare for the worst scenario: a Russian attack on the Ukrainian capital, according to a senior official.

The US mission is only keeping a “core” number of diplomats in Ukraine as it orders most of the staff to leave the country. Some of those diplomats who are staying will relocate to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, according to the official.

“Prudence requires us to assume, to plan for and prepare for a worst-case scenario. And the worst-case scenario would obviously involve substantial Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital,” the official told reporters during a phone call on Saturday morning.

“Russia has a very capable military with substantial combat power, and should it choose to utilize a significant piece of that combat power against the Ukrainian capital, there's plenty of opportunities -- even with restraint and respect for diplomatic facilities -- for things to go wrong,” the official said.

“We're shifting some people [to Lviv] in part because of its closer proximity to US diplomatic and consular facilities in neighboring countries, so we can maintain close coordination with colleagues in those neighboring countries and ensure that, should military action on the part of Russia begin, we can move those people safely, should we decide to do so,” the official said.

The US diplomats will carry out core diplomatic functions and provide “emergency consular services” in Lviv, the official said. But routine services will only be available for Americans in neighboring countries, the official said.

The diplomats are not working from a US facility in Lviv, they are just temporarily in the city, the official said.
