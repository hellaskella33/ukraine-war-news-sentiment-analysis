Russia's invasion of Ukraine is underway.The American side claims that Moscow has asked China to provide military equipment.On Sunday, a representative of the White House warned that Beijing would "bear the consequences" if he would help Russia bypass Western sanctions related to aggression against Ukraine.

US national security advisor Jake Sullivan will meet on Monday in Rome with a high -erected Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi and - according to sources in the White House - he is to signal the possibility of economic sanctions against Beijing, if he helps Russia in the war with Ukraine.

Washington: China will suffer the consequences of breaking sanctions for Russia

Chinese companies that oppose American export restrictions to Russia can be cut off from American hardware and software, which they need to produce products - said US Secretary of US Gina Raimondo last week.

As the Reuters agency notes, China is the largest exporter in the world, the largest trading partner of the European Union and the largest supplier of goods for the United States, and any pressure on Chinese trade can cause a domino effect in the economy of the United States and their allies.

Sullivan said on Sunday in an interview with CNN that Washington was carefully watching to what extent Beijing would give possible economic or material support of Russia.- We directly signal to Beijing that he will bear the consequences for breaking sanctions on a large scale or supporting Russia in breaking them - said Sullivan.

Beijing's attitude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine

Beijing, a key commercial partner of Russia, refused to name Moscow's activities, although the leader of China XI Jinping last week called all the parties to the conflict to "maximum restraint" and expressed concern about the influence of Western sanctions on the global economy.

Daniel Russel, who served as a high -ranking American diplomat for East Asia during the time of President Barack Obama and has close relationships with Biden's administration, called the perspective of playing the role of a mediator by China at the end of the war in Ukraine "not real".
