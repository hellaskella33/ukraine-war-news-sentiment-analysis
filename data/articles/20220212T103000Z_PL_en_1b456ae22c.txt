Jake Sullivan with an assault to Ukraine: one of the scenarios is a quick attack on Kiev

- If Russia attacks Ukraine, it probably begins with bombing and rocket attacks, which will result in victims among civilians, regardless of their nationality - he said and appealed to American citizens to leave Ukraine.

Sullivan emphasized that "Russia has so many strength [gathered at the border with Ukraine - ed.] To carry out a large military operation."The adviser was asked during the conference what a possible invasion could look like.

- It can be a number of different forms of action.One of them is a quick attack on Kiev.This is the script we analyze.Russians can take it.They can also decide to act in other parts of Ukraine.We are deeply convinced that if Russia decided to invade, it would try to create some excuse, provocation, something for which they would be able to blame Ukrainians - he said.- We are talking about it in public, because the world should know that such a provocation can be the cause of a possible attack on Ukraine - he added.
