The president of Moldova has accused Russia of plotting to overthrow its pro-Western leadership in a coup that would involve military-trained saboteurs attacking state institutions and taking hostages.

Russia’s aim was to block Moldova from moving towards membership of the EU and co-opt the country into the war against Ukraine, said Maia Sandu.

The accusation came after Ukraine warned last Thursday that it had intercepted a “plan for the destruction of Moldova by Russian intelligence”.

In an apparent corroboration of that warning, Ms Sandu said Moscow’s alleged plan would involve “saboteurs with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages”.

The saboteurs would include covert operatives from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. Under the guise of opposition protests, they would attempt to “overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power from Chisinau to an illegitimate one, which would put our country at the disposal of Russia, in order to stop the European integration process”, the president said.

Ms Sandu alleged that the plan was backed by Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, two Moldovan oligarchs who are in exile. Both were sanctioned by the US and Britain last year. But she pledged: “The Kremlin’s attempts to bring violence to our country will fail.”
