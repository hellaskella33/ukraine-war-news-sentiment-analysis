Recent clashes between the police and protesters in Georgia, brought on by a controversial "foreign agent" law, have highlighted a major divide between the authorities and the wider population.

On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, thousands of Georgians took to the streets of the capital, Tbilisi, protesting against parliament's backing of the first reading of the proposed law which critics say will limit press freedom and be used to crack down on non-governmental and other rights organisations.

Riot police used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse protesters in front of the parliament building, with some in the crowd shouting "down with the Russian law" - a reference to the fact that the proposed bill mirrors similar legislation in Moscow.

But this issue is only the latest indication of a wider struggle over the future direction of the country between pro-Western and pro-Russian views.

The political rift between the government and the public was already apparent when the Georgian government refused to take sides in the war in Ukraine - despite many Georgians sympathising with Ukraine, with some even going to fight against the Russian army.
