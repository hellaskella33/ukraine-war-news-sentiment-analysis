MINSK, 28 January (BelTA) –Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko commented on the sanctions pressure against Belarus and other states as he delivered his Address to the Belarusian people and the National Assembly in Minsk on 28 January, BelTA has learned.

"Another front of the attack on Belarus is sanctions. This is not just our challenge. This is a global trend, in fact, a technology of global expansion. Sanctions are a traditional practice of the world monopolist: the United States and its ally the European Union. This is how they have always tried to settle score with competitors. Today they are working against China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, and now Belarus. Today, they have imposed sanctions against half the world. Attacking us, they are trying to squeeze our industry flagship companies out of the market," Aleksandr Lukashenko said.

He stressed that sanctions are an element of hybrid war. "In fact, they are working according to the algorithm: sanctions - internal rebellion - military invasion," the head of state noted.

The Belarusian leader also mentioned the now trendy term "smart sanctions". "Allegedly, their impact is selective – only on the authorities. In fact, the West is looking for, methodically and cynically, for the pain points of the economy, conducting truly inhumane experiments. Ultimately, people suffer," Aleksandr Lukashenko stressed.

"We resolutely condemn sanctions. Sanctions are the inquisition of our time, a blatant violation of international law. The corresponding position is enshrined in the ruling of the Belarusian Constitutional Court, and we will proceed from this. The so-called compatriots who call for sanctions commit a crime against the state and their own people. They will be held responsible for this according to the law, wherever they are," the head of state said.
