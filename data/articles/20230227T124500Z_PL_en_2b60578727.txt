Chinese plan on Ukraine

On the anniversary of Russia's assault to Ukraine, a documentary entitled: "China's position on the political regulation of the Ukrainian crisis" appeared on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Chinese authorities consistently do not define Russian aggression against Ukraine as "war".

The document was opposed to the use of nuclear weapons, and the weapon was called to suspend the weapon and undertake dialogue by Russia and Ukraine.The second paragraph of the Chinese proposal is an appeal to abandon the "cold -war mentality", in which it was written that "the security of one of the countries should not be achieved at the expense of another" or "as a result of the development of military pacts".This applies directly to Russian fears regarding the expansion of NATO, which served as an excuse to start a full -scale war.At the same time, Beijing also postulates the abolition of sanctions against Russia.

Before publishing the details of the plan, the President of Ukraine Wołodymyr Zelnski expressed the readiness of meeting with representatives of China.

Earlier, China announced the strengthening of the alliance with Russia.
