The director of NATO Stratcom Coe emphasizes that the organization he manages began to collect data on Russian activity in the information space long before February 24, when Russia's full -size invasion of Ukraine began.Before the attack, a growing disinformation was recorded, and Russian bots in social media were much more active in promoting selected narratives - the expert points out.

A week before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia began to prepare people "for some little war"

- However, we did not observe that they were preparing for a huge war.[...] According to our final conclusions (Russian President Vladimir), Putin did not inform persons responsible for the information sphere about his plans - continues Sarts.- It wasn't until a few days before the assault began to be prepared for this through various social media actions, creating groups used for infiltration in a telegram, "he adds.

As the expert points out, two weeks before February 24 in Russia, the public was said that there would be no war;About a week before the invasion, recipients began to be prepared for "some little war".

Some sources also believe that many high -ranking representatives of the Russian authorities, including the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ławrow, did not know that there would be assault a few days before its beginning - says Sarts.- In the information sphere, no war was prepared on this scale - he sums up.

Russian disinformation.Tiktok with the new area of ​​the Kremlin's activity

When asked if after the invasion of the Russian side, the Russian side began to use some new methods in the field of technology, Sarts draws attention to the greater use of the Telegram messenger by Moscow to spread disinformation.

He also points out that the effectiveness of the Kremlin's actions in Western social media has fallen significantly, because media corporations have undertaken a lot of fighting in this matter.- That is why they returned to the telegram as a center of their disinformation activities, "he indicates. The Russian side also conducts activities on the thicket; this is a new area of ​​their activity - emphasizes the expert.

- In general, the Russian side is aimed at a situation where most of their infrastructure turned out to be not as effective as before the invasion - adds Sarts.For this reason, first of all, they are forced to look for ways to circumvent obstacles, and secondly their priority is the "protection" of the Russian media space against news about what is happening in Ukraine in reality - continues the expert.- Many resources are therefore devoted to information blockade - emphasizes the director of the organization.

Sarts points out that in the first months of the full -size war Russia was not able to largely use Western social media, which "were completely dominated by the Ukrainian side."He adds that, unlike previous wars, which, for example, were reported live by television, this is a live war reported by Ukrainians in social media.

- I think the Russians were not prepared for it.The Russian side was successful on the Russian Vkontakte (Russian counterpart of Facebook - PAP) and in a telegram - adds the director of Stratcom Coe.

At the same time - continues - Russia works quite effectively on various platforms on the so -calledGlobal South: in African countries, in South America, in the Middle East."There, their disinformation campaigns, translating the guilt for the conflict to the West and Ukraine, were quite effective," says Sarts.What was done in terms of fighting disinformation in Western Europe was not made in a large part of the world, which is why "Russia had a much greater free hand when it comes to actions in these environments" - explains the interlocutor of PAP.
