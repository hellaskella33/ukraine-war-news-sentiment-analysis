Vladimir Putin compared German tanks deployed in Ukraine to the Nazis sweeping across eastern Europe as he addressed Russia in a symbolic speech on the anniversary of the end of the bitter battle for Stalingrad.

The Russian president flew to Volgograd, which was renamed Stalingrad for the day, to take part in memorial events marking 80 years since the end of the devastating siege that helped to turn the tide of war in Russia's favour against Adolf Hitler's army.

Mr Putin, who has adopted an almost manic reverence of World War Two, spent more than half of the speech comparing the Soviet Union’s struggle with Nazism to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that will soon enter its second year.

The Russian president, who has portrayed the invasion as “liberation” of the Ukrainian people from Western influence, proclaimed that a new “Nazi-like” ideology in Europe is “creating direct threats to our country’s security”.
