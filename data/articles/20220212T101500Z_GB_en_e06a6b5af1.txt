Russia has denounced the US' "peak hysteria" surrounding the Ukraine conflict but said Russian President Vladimir Putin and US leader Joe Biden had agreed to continue dialogue.

Speaking after new phone talks between Mr Putin and Mr Biden, the Kremlin's top foreign policy advisor Yury Ushakov told a conference call: "Hysteria has reached its peak" but added that "the presidents have agreed to continue contacts at all levels".

Mr Ushakov also told Russian news agencies the chat with Biden was "balanced and business-like", our Moscow correspondent Nataliya Vasilyeva reports.

Mr Ushakov said President Biden requested the call on invasion fears that the Kremlin adviser described as "unprecedented and coordinated American hysteria about the alleged imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine."

He said Biden mentioned possible sanctions against Russia in case of an investigation "but did not dwell on it."

The pronouncement comes after Mr Putin told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron earlier on Saturday that accusations Moscow plans to attack Ukraine were "provocative speculation" and could lead to a conflict in the ex-Soviet country.

In a statement, the Kremlin accused Kyiv's allies of sending "modern weapons" to the ex-Soviet country and being unwilling to force Kyiv authorities to implement Western-brokered agreements to halt a festering conflict in eastern Ukraine.

In his phone call with the Russian leader this afternoon, Joe Biden warned that an invasion of Ukraine would bring "widespread human suffering" and "diminish Russia's standing" in the global sphere.

In a telephone conversation between the two leaders that lasted over an hour, the US President also warned of "swift and severe costs" if Ukraine were to be invaded.
