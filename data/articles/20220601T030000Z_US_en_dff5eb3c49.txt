"It is a catastrophe" .. CNN camera in Lesicansk after being exposed to Russia's most fierce raids on Ukraine

(CNN)- US President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that his country will provide Ukraine "with more advanced missile systems and ammunition" as its war with Russia continues.

Biden said, in an opinion article for the New York Times that the United States’s goal in Ukraine is “a democratic, independent and sovereign vision and possessing means of defense and deterrence against more aggression.” He added that the shipment of new weapons “will enable Ukraine to strike major goals with more accuratebattlefield".

During the article, the US President sought to clarify the goals of the United States in Ukraine, and was keen to highlight that the United States is not looking to engage in conflict with Russia directly.

Biden said: "We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia, as much as I do not agree with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, and I find his anger, the United States will not try to overthrow it in Moscow," Biden said.

It is noteworthy that almost two months ago, the American President announced that Putin "cannot stay in power."

"As long as the United States or our allies are not attacked, we will not participate directly in this conflict, whether by sending American forces to fight in Ukraine or attack Russian forces," Biden added in the article.

He continued: "We do not encourage Ukraine or enable it to hit sites outside its borders. We do not want to extend the war just because the pain is attached to Russia."

Biden said that US officials "currently do not see any indication that Russia intends to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, although Russian discourse is in itself dangerous and very responsible."

The US President stated: "Let me be clear: that is, the use of nuclear weapons in this struggle on any scope that will be unacceptable at all for us, as well as for the rest of the world and will have severe consequences."
