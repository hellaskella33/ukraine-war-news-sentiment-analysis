MINSK, 7 May (BelTA) – Belarus will instantly respond to any military aggression against the country. Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko made the statement during a solemn meeting on the occasion of Victory Day on 7 May, BelTA has learned.





Aleksandr Lukashenko said: “If things are quiet, it is fine. Then things will be calm and quiet in our country, too. If someone uses weapons against us, we will respond. And instantly at that. We will not draw any lines. We don’t have thousands upon thousands of kilometers of territory Russia has. Russia can draw lines and wait for something. It is impossible to capture Russia right away. But the latest war demonstrated that Belarus can cease to exist within a month. It could be done even faster these days. This is why no lines. Absolutely none. Any aggression will be met with an instant response.”
