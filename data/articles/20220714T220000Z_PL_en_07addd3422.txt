Just 40 kilometers from the front line, in the region, where the biggest fights are taking place now, the last obstetric clinic in Donbas is operating.Doctors say that due to stress and fear that during the war is constantly accompanied by pregnant women, the staff of the institution more and more often have to face premature births.Material "Facts about the world" TVN24 BIS.

The windows are protected with sandbags, and women give birth only in rooms, which are separated from the outside by at least two walls.

- This room here is relatively safe.In Mariupol we have already witnessed that nothing would protect the hospital from bombing - says Dr. Ivan Cichanok, head of the Obstetrics Clinic in Pokrowsk.

The facility in Pokrowsk is the last obstetric hospital that works in Donbass in the territory controlled by Ukraine.

- The Pokrowskie Perinatal Center was established in 2015.It was one of three such facilities in the Donetsk region.Supported over half a million people.Now only us stayed.The center in Mariupol was completely destroyed, and in Kramator - evacuated - explains Dr. Ivan Cichanok.

The hospital is only 40 kilometers away from the front line.To say that the conditions for doctors and patients are not easy, it's like saying nothing.

- I was so terrified, the windows were shaking, the whole building was shaking, and I stayed with one of the patients in the delivery room.Everyone else was in the basement, but I couldn't escape, we must help these women - says midwife Svetlana Władimir.

Continuous threat of fire, uncertainty about the future and constant stress meant that the number of premature births is growing rapidly in Ukraine.According to doctors, in the first weeks of the war, every second delivery in Kharkov was premature.Similarly in Lviv, where the number of premature babies doubled or even tripled.

- Bombing affects my nerves, I would like to evacuate from here - confesses patient Wiktoria Sokołowska.

A larger number of premature babies during the war

Premature babies are children born between 22 and 37 weeks of pregnancy.Those who were born before the 34th week go to the incubator.

In the institution in Pokrowsk in 2021, with just over 1,000 children born there about 12 percent were born before the 37th week of pregnancy.Although from Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the total number of births has definitely decreased, the premature birth rate increased to 16 percent.

- Uncertainty is the most terrifying.We do not know what will happen next - says the patient Katerina Burawcowa.Her son was born in the 28th week of pregnancy, i.e. in the 7th month.According to doctors, he would probably not have a chance to survive if he did not have hospital care.

In Donbas, the war began not a few months, but a few years ago.Shortly after the opening of the facility in Pokrowsk in 2015, i.e. a year after the outbreak of the conflict in the region, doctors at the center began to collect data on the impact of the war on pregnancy.

According to the author of the study, the gynecologist and midwife Olesi Kusznarenko, more than half of the women she examined had a placental dysfunction, which appears when oxygen and nutrients are not sufficiently transmitted to the fetus.It is an indicator four times higher than the one occurring in a control group, not being stressed by war.
