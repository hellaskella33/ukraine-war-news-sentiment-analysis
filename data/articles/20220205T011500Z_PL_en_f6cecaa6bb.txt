For example, in the north of Ukraine, there are about 100,000miles of wet areas known as Pinsk swamps.Here is one place where the low temperature can really play a role.In winter, the muddy plains freeze, providing a more stable area for heavy vehicles that would still get stuck in the mud.Experts say that the frozen land occurring in February can provide Russian troops with the best window to enter Ukraine - says the American daily.

Historically, swamps played a large role in conflicts, but this time the muddy landscape may not be a decisive factor - according to the Center for Naval Analyssiss Russia Studies program (CNA)."While these swamps have been marked as a potential threat to Western forces fought by a hypothetical war in the USSR and considered" impassable except for winter ", the Russian troops have long been perfectly coping with the marsh are" - we read.

The swamps stretch, among othersIn a key strategic place: on the Belarusian border.When the Earth freezes, this can give Russian army access to Kiev, which is located only 56 miles south, although this most direct route runs through the place of the Nuclear Catastrophe in Chernobyl.In November, Ukraine sent border guards to patrol this area.In the event of a conflict, any artillery explosions and fire in the area may be dangerous.

-Providing air-earth, artillery, mortars and many rocket launchers on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border can also distract radioactive remains in the soil-explains Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer.

Many expect, however, that potential Russian military aggression will also come from the north -east and east, where Promoskie separatists control the Ukrainian territory in Donbas, and Russian troops gathered on the border with Ukraine.

In the event of an invasion, the Russians can drive through Kharkiv.There are no geographical obstacles separating this metropolis from Russia, which makes it a fast and easy goal.Following further, all invasive forces would reach the banks of the Dnieper, a river that symbolically divides Ukraine to the east and west, "emphasizes" Washington Post ".

The waterway would be a key factor during the invasion of Belarus or Russia.For example, in Zaporozho there is a hydroelectric power plant and a powerful dam connecting the banks of the river.During World War II, the Soviets destroyed this dam to make it difficult to cross the river to Germany.The dam was later rebuilt.Experts note that Ukraine could now repeat this tactic to slow down the Russian invasion.The destruction of the dam could, however, cause tragic damage in the surrounding cities.

Further, as American journalists indicate, in the south of Ukraine there is the Black Sea, a place of many conflicts in history.In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, gaining wider access to this reservoir.It is also one of the key places on the map.The Kerch Strait, dividing the Black Sea and the Azov Sea, can be another point of access to Ukraine.In 2018, Russia built a bridge running through the strait directly connecting it with Crimea.
