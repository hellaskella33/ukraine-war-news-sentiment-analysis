"We continue to call for an immediate end to Russia's war of aggression and for Russia to facilitate unhindered access to providers of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and safe passage for those who seek to move to safer areas," Blinken said.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, more than six million people have fled the country and more than five million have been internally displaced, according to the US State Department.
