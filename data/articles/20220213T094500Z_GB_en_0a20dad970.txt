Poland has said it is braced for a massive influx of refugees fleeing Ukraine, as flights to the country were redirected and cancelled, prompting fears it could be cut off ahead of a Russian invasion.

Mariusz Kaminski, the Polish interior minister, said Warsaw was preparing for a number of scenarios, including a need to set up accommodation for refugees fleeing across the western border.

"In connection with the situation in Ukraine we are preparing for various scenarios. One of them is regional preparations related to a possible influx of refugees from Ukraine," he said.

Insurers are understood to be cutting back aviation cover for flights through Ukrainian airspace, as Russia continues to amass huge amounts of firepower at the country's borders.

Dutch airline KLM has already said it will stop flying to Ukraine, while Germany's Lufthansa said it was also considering a suspension of flights.
