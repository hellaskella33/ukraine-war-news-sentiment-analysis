"I grew up speaking Russian, I am Russian by blood, but I don't associate myself with Russia or the Russian world," says Anatoly Deryugin, a major in the Latvian army.

Anatoly, 43, is one of more than one in three Latvians who speak Russian as their first language. They are now under pressure to prove their loyalty because of Russia's war in Ukraine.

Born and raised in Latvia, he has spent more than half his life in his country's military. His mother is also a Russian-speaker from Latvia, and his father is from eastern Ukraine.

If Maj Deryugin had to defend his country he would fight for Latvia, even if there were Russians like him on the other side of the front line: "If a robber or a murderer comes to your house, no matter what ethnicity he is, Russian-speaking or not, you don't care where he comes from. He is no longer a brother or a friend."

But most Russian-speakers in Latvia have spent their lives absorbing Russian state TV, because of a lack of Russian-language content in their own country. And that has left many seeing the world through a narrative that portrays the idea of a united Russian world with the Kremlin at its centre.
