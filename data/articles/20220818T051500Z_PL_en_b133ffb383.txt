The French network of DIY stores Leroy Merlin is one of the companies whose attitude was extremely criticized after the start of the war in Ukraine.Its owner, the ADEO group, not only decided to stay in Russia, but even to increase deliveries to this market.This resulted in a consumer boycott, which, however, will not find out the reader of Polish -language Wikipedia, the most popular online encyclopedia edited by the volunteer community.The content of the war in Ukraine was at some point added to the article about Leroy Merlin.Later, however, they were removed.

This is not the only example.Wikipedia is most often silent about the controversies around companies criticized for their attitude towards Russia, except for one exception.A short mention is found only in the article about Auchan."The network did not decide to withdraw from the Russian market after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, which aroused widespread indignation among Polish Internet users" - you can read there.

Similar information cannot be found in articles, e.g. about Renault, Decathlon, Metro AG or Credit Suisse.The history of editing articles on these companies does not show that someone tried to add content about Russian aggression.However, there are also companies in which the articles were made to complement, but the changes have been removed.In addition to Leroy Merlin, it's about Nestlé and Olx.In the latter case, it was added: "During Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Avito.ru, associated with the OLX group, participates in the recruitment of soldiers to the Russian army."However, this fragment is gone.

Polish -language Wikipedia is silent about the companies that remained in Russia

The shape of the content in Wikipedia is concerned about Mykola Kniażycki, MP of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, known from the appeal to Polish politicians to increase pressure on companies that remained in Russia.- Information about Boykat is not a rating, but the facts.For me, a Ukrainian politician, it is very important that they are in articles on an equal footing with other facts about the data of companies - he tells us.

So why is there no such content?- Each language version of Wikipedia is created, changing and managed by a dispersed and decentralized user community, free volunteers editing a given language version.In the case of Polish -language Wikipedia, we are talking about 3994 active people over the last 30 days - explains Maciej Padzikiewicz, a member of the Wikimedia Polska management team and the administrator of the Polish -language Wikipedia.He points out that none of the volunteers can speak on behalf of the entire community, so they only present their own view of the situation.

He notes that in the case of Leroy Merlin, the mention of Bojkot was almost 25 percent.The volume of the article, meanwhile, according to the view of many Wikipedists, new events, not recognized by historians for significant, should not constitute a majority of article.He adds that in the case of Nestlé, information about Bojkocie appeared again.It happened just after "Rzeczpospolita" became interested in the matter.

There are no similar problems in English -language Wikipedia.There, information about the company's policy towards the Russian market is as standard in departments entitled "controversy" or "critic".They can be found in articles on those brands whose policy is silent with Polish -language Wikipedia, such as Decathlon, Leroy Merlin, OLX, Renault, Philip Morris, Credit Suisse and Metro AG.- Such content should be available in all languages.Their lack in the Polish version is puzzling - says Mykola Kniażycki.
