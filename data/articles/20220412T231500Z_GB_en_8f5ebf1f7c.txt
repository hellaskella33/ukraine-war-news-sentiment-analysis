Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, has chosen his public appearances carefully throughout the conflict in Ukraine.

On day 48 of the war, he held a press event at a spaceport in Russia's east to say his country would fight on until it achieved its goals.

He set out why he believed the invasion was necessary, repeating disproven claims that genocide was taking place against Russian-speakers in Ukraine.

The aim, he said, was to "help people".

"It's clear that we didn't have a choice. It was the right decision," Mr Putin said today about the invasion. "The goals are perfectly clear, they are noble."
