Former Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico is spreading through foreign media pro-Russian narratives, claiming that "Slovakia is being drawn into the war in Ukraine."

The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine announced this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.

Former Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, known for his pro-Russian stance, has been spreading in the foreign media space the idea that Slovakia has "lost a high-quality multi-million defense system" because of Ukraine and the United States, and that "Slovakia is being drawn into the war in Ukraine.

"Of course, the politician stops short of noting who is fighting against whom," the statement reads.

It is noted that pro-Russian rhetoric has been characteristic of Fico's speeches for at least the last eight years, since Russia captured Crimea and parts of Donbas.

In particular, he earlier stated that "Ukraine, unlike Russia, doesnâ€™t comply with the Minsk agreements," that "Russia cannot be held responsible for the Ukrainian conflict," and that "the West must lift sanctions off Russia."

According to the Center for Countering Disinformation, Fico circulated these propaganda theses not only through the Kremlin media, but also through leading foreign platforms, such as Reuters and Politico.

As Ukrinform reported earlier, the CCD has published a selection of Russian fake news alleging that Ukraine had run nuclear research to "undermine European security."
