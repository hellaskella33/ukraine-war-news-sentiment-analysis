HSBC has deleted references to “war” in Ukraine from reports written by its analysts as the bank resists pressure to close down its Russian operations.

Moscow has insisted the invasion of its neighbour is a “special military operation” carried out in self-defence and is not a war of aggression.

Committees that review HSBC’s publications have changed the word “war” to “conflict” in “multiple” reports, the Financial Times reported.

The Telegraph has seen a copy of one analyst report published last Friday that contained one mention of “war in Ukraine”, referring to an FT article, and one of “conflict in Ukraine”.

HSBC has “about 200 staff” in Russia who focus on serving multinationals operating inside the country, according to the FT.

The bank said it had been “steadily reducing its Russian business for the last decade” but would “continue to operate” regardless of the war.

Other banks such as Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas have said they will withdraw from Russia following the invasion.

Russia has recently passed laws threatening jail sentences of up to 15 years for spreading “fake” information about the Ukraine war.

“Fake” is widely understood to mean any information not previously approved by Russian authorities.

Although aimed at news organisations to prevent Russian citizens from learning the truth about the Ukraine war, the law also applies to communications from banks and other businesses.

HSBC has previously come under fire for failing to criticise authoritarian governments.

China’s crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong, including a controversial national security law, was backed by its Asia-Pacific chief executive, Peter Wong, who signed a petition backing the new law at the time.

Critics said it would outlaw freedom of speech and erode judicial independence in the former British colony.
