The US defence department has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting with "depravity" in his invasion of Ukraine.

Spokesman John Kirby became visibly emotional as he asked how anyone "moral" could justify the atrocities committed by Russia.

But Russia's ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has rejected the accusation.

He described Mr Kirby's comment as "offensive and unacceptable".

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday he was still open to peace talks with Mr Putin.

But he said there was a high risk they could collapse amid Russian aggression.

Speaking to Polish media, Mr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Putin because "a single man decides everything" in Russia.

But the destruction left by Russian forces in occupied areas has made any discussions tenuous, he said. "After Bucha and Mariupol people just want to kill them. When there is such attitude, it is hard to talk about anything."
