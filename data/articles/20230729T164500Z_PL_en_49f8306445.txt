- The era of Vladimir Putin will end in the next 12 months - believes Christopher Steele, who managed the Russian Faculty of British intelligence in 2006-2009.The former spy stated in an interview with Sky News that from the West's perspective the worst scenario would be the sudden death of Putin in the assassination.Such an attack would be organized by nationalists from Russian security services who lost their faith in Putin, but want to continue the invasion of Ukraine.

How will Putin's power end?There was a spy: an assassination, uprising, voluntary resignation

According to Steele, the assassination would not bring significant changes in the war and Russian foreign policy, but could lead to the creation of a transient regime.General Sergei Surowikin, commander of the Russian Air Force, would lead as a president.

Another, less likely path to overthrow Putin would be to the creation of a nationalist, e.g. the head of the Wagner group, Jewgenija Prigo≈ºyna, or supporters of the imprisoned leader of the Russian opposition, Aleksiej Nawalny.

Steele also indicated a peaceful scenario in which Putin resigns from participating in elections scheduled for March 2024, but after resignation with his family he is covered by a guarantee of security and inviolability - as was the case of Boris Yeltsin, when he gave power in Russia in 1999.

Who will replace Putin?The former spy gave four names

The former spy predicts that if Vladimir Putin actually gave way, his successor would be the director of FSB Aleksander Bortnikov, Governor of the Tulski District Alexei Diumin or son of the Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Patruszew, oligarcha Igorcha Sieczin or former Prime Minister of Russia Wiktor Zubkov.

For months, there has also been talk about the allegedly deadly illness of Vladimir Putin.Irish Premier Leo Varadkar, asked if Ireland would make condolences after the death of a Russian dictator, said "I don't think", and after a while he added that "this is a good question" and that "he didn't think about it before"."I can't imagine Ireland to send its delegation to the funeral," he said in an interview with The Independent.

In November last year, Varadkar was banned from entering Russia in connection with sanctions against 52 key representatives of the Irish authorities who were to express "Russophobic moods".
