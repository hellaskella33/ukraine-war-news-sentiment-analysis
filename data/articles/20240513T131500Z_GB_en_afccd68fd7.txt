At first glance, Andrei Belousov does not appear to fit the mould of a Russian defence minister.

Known for his spreadsheet wizardry and grasp of Keynesian economics, he is more at home with columns of data than of tanks.

But Vladimir Putin has chosen Mr Belousov, described as the Kremlin’s most gifted and most illiberal economist, and given him a clear mission – to win in Ukraine and prepare Russia for a long-term conflict against Nato.

These are projects Putin regards as central to his legacy as Russia’s leader and he wanted a bureaucrat, not a military man, for the job.

Sergei Shoigu had been criticised for his inability to overcome bureaucratic inertia undermining Moscow’s war effort.

Mr Belousov, a 65-year-old Putin loyalist, is known for his sharp analytical mind and head for figures.
