- The borders of Poland and Lithuania with Russia should be strengthened, minefields should be erected now, in peace.During the war it may be too late to build fortifications in border areas - said General Waldemar Skrzypczak.

The topic of the use of mines to defend Poland appeared as a result of the experience of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.During the fighting, it turned out that it was still a very effective way of defending key places.

Securing the eastern border of Poland in the fields of mine would be part of the concept of the so -calledthe Baltic defense line, i.e. strategic defensive lines defending Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland against aggression from Russia and Belarus.

One key "but".The monitors are clearly putting the matter

According to the concept, the defense line would consist of, among othersfrom fields of anti -tank mines, ditches, barbed wires and "dragon teeth".Although this is only a concept for now, there is one key "but" in the whole story.

The problem is that Poland has signed a "convention on the ban on the use, storage, production and transfer of anti -personnel mines and about their destruction" from 1997 to use min on the border, the government would have to pronounce the convention.

In addition, the Ministry of Defense in an interview with the newspaper "Do Rzeczy" announced that "it does not consider securing the eastern border of the Republic of Poland with traditional anti -personnel mines".

Latvia buys faces.Poles are not convinced

The Latvian Ministry of Defense has a slightly different approach to the matter, which plans to buy various types of anti -tank mines and controlled anti -personnel mines.Mine fields will not arise during the room, but explosives will be stored close to the border so that they can be used quickly if necessary.

In February, the Ibris research agency at the request of "Rzeczpospolita" asked Poles if they wanted the Polish border with Belarus and Russia to be mined.This idea liked 28.3 percent.respondents.17.7 percentHe was against and the others had no opinion.
