General Pacek: Today it is a war for exhaustion

General Pacek said that "this war shows the situation in a moment."- We were dealing with compromise on the Russian side several times.The first - when the Russians tried to conquer Kiev, the second - when they escaped from the Kharkiv region.You can find a few more similar ones.But this does not mean that the Russians have already lost this war - he emphasized.He also added that "this war also changed its goal a bit."- The first goal was to strongly conquer the whole of Ukraine, later - (conquer) part, primarily the eastern one.And today it is a war for exhaustion, also for the exhaustion of the Russian side, because the Ukrainians are pursuing this goal - he pointed out.- But I see it so that the Russians took a glove.Putin - ironically - understood what Joe Biden said, talking about weakening Russia.Today he is trying to exhaust Ukraine - he continued.

According to General Pack, this war "is a great collective crime, crime."- There are plenty of these crimes, it's not just Bucza and Mariupol.(...) is the destruction of Ukraine, not only war, but also civilian, on a large scale - he said.In his opinion, "we are dealing with a stalemate, still compromising for Russia."

Dyner: Türkiye has gently made half a step towards Ukraine more than before

Anna Maria Dyner, commenting on the war situation, drew attention to the words that the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently said in the context of Ukraine, who met in Istanbul with President Volodymyr Zelnski.Erdogan emphasized that Russia and Ukraine "should return to peace conversations" and "Ukraine deserves membership in NATO."

- It can be clearly seen that Türkiye has been gently taking half a step towards Ukraine more than before - said the analyst.

- Of course, this is symbolic just before the summit (NATO) in Vilnius.However, we are waiting for a different decision of Turkey, i.e. in fact to unlock Sweden's accession to the alliance, that this will finally happen and to close this process, which was started just after Russian aggression to Ukraine - she added.
