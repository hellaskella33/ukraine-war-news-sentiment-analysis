"Financial Times", based on high -ranking German officials, describes that Berlin is afraid of creating a precedent for other countries.In a situation that the EU actually transferred the frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank to Ukraine or stopped the influence of investing money, Poland could effectively sue Germany for reparations for the destruction resulting from the Second World War.On the other hand, the German Minister of Justice Marco Buschmann analyzed EU proposals regarding the attachment of Russian assets and came to the conclusion that their implementation would be illegal - we read.

Poland is not inferior

In recent months, the issue of reparations has become another reason for cooling Polish-German relations.Poland demands 1.3 trillion euros from Germany.In April this yearThe Polish government adopted a resolution on the need to regulate in Polish-German relations issues of reparations, compensation and compensation in connection with Germany's assault on Poland in 1939 and later German occupation.The report on losses was in May this year.handed over to the German side by the deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arkadiusz Mularczyk.Berlin, however, consistently refuses to negotiate on this subject and emphasizes that the case has been legally regulated.

Meanwhile, Mularczyk, asked in May by the daily "Die Welt", whether there is now a good time for reparation claims - in the face of war in Ukraine, when Europe should stick together = he replied that "if someone is conducting a brutal invasive war, he committed terrible war crimes, it must be punished, restitution and compensation are needed. "

Loss of pressure tool on Russia

Leon Wansleben, an expert for central banks, cited by the Wednesday edition of "Berliner Zeitung" at the Max Planck Institute, also calculated other reasons why Germany is not giving up to transferring frozen Russian banking assets to Ukraine.He stated that in this way "the West's promise regarding the management of the free flow of capital and the functioning payment system would be broken."In his opinion, the West is afraid of not only legal consequences, but also political and economic.A block could be created around China and Russia that would create its own payment and financial structures.By transferring EUR 200 billion Ukraine, the European Union would also lose the pressure tool in possible peace negotiations.The release of EUR 200 billion could be an argument to make Russia to make concessions - believes the expert.

In March 2022, after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission appointed the "Freeze and Seize" task group.Its purpose is to ensure better coordination of EU sanctions against Russian and Belarusian citizens and enterprises, as well as enabling EU Member States, Eurojust and Europol cooperation in the field of identification, freezing and - as far as possible - confiscation of Russian property.

Various ideas for reconstruction

To best use frozen funds and start the reconstruction of Ukraine, the Commission proposed to the Member States various variants.They includeManagement of frozen Russian public assets, investing them and using profits for Ukraine.The World Bank currently estimates the costs of rebuilding the country destroyed by the country to EUR 380 billion.As the Financial Times he said, the EU diplomat involved in the case "the challenge is to determine what is legally justified and defended. This is more comprehensive than anyone thought at the beginning."
