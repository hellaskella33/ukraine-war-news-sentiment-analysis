MINSK, 14 February (BelTA) – The West is trying to unleash a conflict involving Ukraine, but no one plans to fight against it, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said as he met with Ukrainian politician and statesman Alexander Moroz on 14 February, BelTA informs.

“I already see that your politicians are starting to deviate from the general policy pursued by the West. I know exactly what the West is up to today: they want to unleash a conflict using someone else or, even better, to start a war using someone else, like Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians. They think: let them die - this is far away,” Aleksandr Lukashenko said.

The president emphasized that the West is keeping on the boil talks about Russia's attack on Ukraine. “Listen, if some kind of war against Ukraine was planned, the mass media would behave in a completely different way. In fact, the media is like an artillery preparation in a modern war. Every time this clamor about the war in Ukraine subsides, America gives a signal to bring it back again, and this hysteria starts to heat up again. In other words, it is clear who needs this war,” the head of state noted.
