Belarus.Alaxandr Lukashenko raves about the fact that it was not Russia and Belarus that began the war in Ukraine

- I absolutely agree with President Putin when he says that we did not start this war.It did not even start in 2014. It began long before 2014 - said Lukashenko at the beginning, which is quoted by the state agency Belta.

Lukashenko is also convinced that the war in Ukraine would start, but the later Moscow would decide to do so, including "worse conditions for Russia and Belarus" this start.- Everything was going in this direction.Probably our only mistake was that we did not solve this issue in 2014-2015, when Ukraine had neither the army nor readiness ... Everyone wanted to solve somehow peacefully.And at that time, armed forces were created - said the dictator, blaming Ukraine.

Lukashenko agreed to be Putin's puppet?

Further Lukashenko stated that Western Europe helped Ukraine because it expected an armed conflict, and even allegedly wanted "irritation of Russia" to end in war.According to Western media, incl.Politico, the words of the President of Belarus, clearly indicate that the politician has accepted that he must be a puppet of Vladimir Putin.

"After the Kremlin helped him repel mass street protests after the forged presidential elections in 2020, the Belarusian dictator put everything on Putin, helping Moscow to start invasion of Ukraine on a full scale in February 2022 with the territory of Belarus" - believes Politico.
