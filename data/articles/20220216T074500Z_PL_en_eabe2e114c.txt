"The actions of Russia in Syria can rather be a model"

In the morning conversation Gazeta.pl Paweł Zalewski was just talking about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.- If this happens, because for now Putin has deployed his troops around Ukraine in order to blackmail, he probably has variant plans depending on which of his actions will bring results.I assume that one of these plans is to cause a hot conflict, but it's probably in the future.Here, the actions of Russia in Syria can be a model, where she avoided direct clashes, where she rather used air raids - he said.

As he noted, "Putin did not destabilize Ukraine, Ukrainians are united."- Putin's goal was also to break up the West and here thanks to the definite American leadership, this unity failed to break up - he said.- Putin treats humiliation and arrogance only as an instrument of politics.This is Russia today, this is the Kremlin today.However, what is crucial for him is to prevent the Ukrainians succeed by applying other rules than in Russia, going to the West side - he added.

CJEU judgment on Poland and the conditional mechanism

Paweł Zalewski in the morning conversation of Gazeta.pl was also asked about the judgment of the CJEU regarding the mechanism of conditionality.Recall, it is about provisions that make the payment of funds dependent on issues related to the rule of law.At the beginning of December, the General spokesman of the CJEU found the regulations consistent with the EU law and did not share the arguments of Warsaw and Budapest, which requested that the regulation be annulled.The opinion of the General Ombudsman is a clue for the judges of the EU Court of Justice, they can take it into account, but they do not have to.

The politician said that there is a "great risk", that Poland would not receive money not only from the national reconstruction plan, but also from the European Union's framework budget.- The more is the greater responsibility on the government's side to change these bad rights, destroying the credibility of the Polish judiciary.If the purpose of these PiS changes was to destroy independence, addictive judges on each other, it cannot be recognized not only by Poles, but also by everyone in the EU, because the European Union is based exactly on the independence and credibility of the judiciary - said Paweł Zalewski.- I hope that this will force the PiS policy search.After all, today it can be seen that if we have a very serious threat from the East, then we have to settle very deeply in the West, and there we settle ourselves in such a way that we are law -abiding, we respect the law, not the will of the dictator, as in Russia - he added.
