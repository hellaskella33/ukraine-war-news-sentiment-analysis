Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the mercenary Wagner group, has launched a coup against Russian military leaders, saying he has 25,000 fighters ready to “end this mess”.

Russian soldiers across the country have been put on high alert as Prigozhin’s forces march towards Moscow.

He accused Russian generals of carrying out on air strike on his fighters in Ukraine and said a “huge number” had been killed, without providing evidence.

In an audio message late on Friday night, Prigozhin said his troops were entering Rostov, a large city in the south of Russia that the Russian top military command have been using as their base.

“We crossed the state border in all places,” Prigozhin said. “The border guards came out to meet and hugged our fighters.

“We are entering Rostov. We don’t fight children. [Russian Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu kills children. He put 18-year-old boys against us. These guys will live and go back to their mothers. But we will destroy everything that gets in the way.”

He later claimed his troops had shot down a Russian military helicopter after it opened fire on civilians in Rostov, though again he did not offer evidence of this claim.

Prigozhin claimed to have taken control of Rostov, including all military establishments and the airport, and he said dozens of Russian solders had joined his coup. Troops have been photographed detaining people in s

Declared a ‘foreign agent’ by Moscow

The FSB, Russia’s main intelligence service, said that it had opened a criminal case against Prigozhin, once considered one of Vladimir Putin’s most trusted fixers, and declared him to be a “foreign agent”.

The case accuses Prigozhin of launching an “armed rebellion inside Russia”. The FSB added: “This is punishable with between 12 and 20 years in prison.”

It also called on Wagner group members to ignore Prighozin and arrest him if they could.
