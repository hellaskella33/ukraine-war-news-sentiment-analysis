MINSK, 10 February (BelTA) - Russia has no need to attack Ukraine, Russian political scientist, publicist Sergei Kurginyan said on the air of the ONT TV channel on 9 February, BelTA has learned.

"Russia is not going to invade Ukraine. It has no need to do this," the political scientist stressed.

According to Sergei Kurginyan, it is only the United States of America that needs a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The confrontation between the two blocs has been on for several decades already, and the Americans still cannot put an end to this issue. "It is impossible to engage with Russia in a nuclear war, a direct confrontation. But starting a medium-sized war without nuclear weapons is something that the Americans love to do,‚Äù he noted.

"The Americans believe that Russia can lose a war with Ukraine either directly or indirectly," Sergei Kurginyan added. "Then, following this victory in Cold War 2.0, they will dismember Russia, thus finally solving the Russian issue, and celebrate a triumphant victory."
