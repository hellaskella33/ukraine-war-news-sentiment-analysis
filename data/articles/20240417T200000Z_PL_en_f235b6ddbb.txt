On Tuesday, the American Institute of Research on War (ISW) announced on Tuesday, April 16, about the potential consequences of the conviction that the war in Ukraine would remain in an impasse regardless of the US operations."This assumption is false" - the experts emphasized.Russia not only does not stop in its imperial plan to take over Ukrainian lands, but also accelerates.

One of the signals is that the Russians break out of the positional war and begin to base their tactics on various maneuvers.Experts indicate that the reason is delays in the transfer of military assistance by the USA."Ukraine cannot now maintain current lines without rapid resumption of US help, especially in the field of air defense and artillery, which only the US can provide quickly and on a large scale," the Institute informed.

Deficiencies in artillery and air defense are to facilitate the Russians screenshots from thousands of bombs to Ukrainian positions and the use of armored columns without incurring prohibitive losses."The Russians use their advantage and slowly, but they systematically move on several sections of the front. From the beginning of this year, Russian forces took over 360 square kilometers," analysts said.

The Institute of War Research alerted that "delaying or suspending military assistance would lead to the dramatic profits of Russia in 2024 and 2025 and ultimately to its victory."According to analysts, America has only two real possibilities to choose from.One of them is a quick resumption of military aid, which will translate into stabilizing the front line.However, the alternative is to allow Russia to defeat the Ukrainian army and move towards NATO borders from the Black Sea to Central Poland."There is no third option," it was emphasized.

According to ISW, the possible victory of Russia in Ukraine would have destructive consequences for NATO defense.On the other hand, the success of Ukraine, even in the case of maintaining the current line of the front, would hinder the potential attack of Russia on Poland or the Baltic States."Russian military leaders planning the invasion of the Baltic States or an attack on Poland will have to assume that Ukraine can proceed to such a war on behalf of NATO, regardless of membership status," ISW analysts informed.

There is also a fear that in the event of Russia's victory, it may threaten NATO from the territory of Ukraine, due to the use of its industry and forcing citizens to fight against the alliance."Therefore, in this terrible scenario, NATO must expect a clash with large Russian conventional forces on its entire border from the Black Sea to the Arctic, which for the first time exposes the southern borders of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania to the risk of Russian land attack from the fall of the Soviet Union" - experts pointed out.

Politicians also alert about the terrible situation in Ukraine.The head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Representatives Michael McCaul recently stated that "Kharkiv is on the verge of fall."Russia also has plans for the lands west of Bachmut in the area of time Jar.The Ukrainian General Oleksandr Syrski announced that the Russian army is to take this area until May 9, i.e. until the day of victory, which would be a war symbol.More information on this subject can be found in the article: "Alarming news on Ukraine.
