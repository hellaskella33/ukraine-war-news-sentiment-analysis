The authoritarian Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, on Thursday blamed Ukraine for provoking Russia’s full-scale invasion last year, and he insisted that Belarus was “a peaceful nation” despite allowing its territory to be used as a staging ground for the war.

But in typically convoluted remarks at a news conference in Minsk, Lukashenko seemed to once again resist any pressure from Moscow to send his own troops into Ukraine, warning that he would do so only if his country was attacked.
