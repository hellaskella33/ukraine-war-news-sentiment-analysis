American intelligence: the Russian army will need years to rebuild

"Russia probably does not want a direct armed conflict with the US and NATO forces, but there is potential for this to happen. Russian leaders have so far avoided taking action that would expand the conflict beyond the borders of Ukraine, but the risk of escalation remains significant" - wrote in the report.According to the American intelligence, the attack on Ukraine reduced the likelihood of Moscow's military intervention in other post -Soviet countries.

The report stated that the war that had been going on since February 24 last year weakened "Air and Land conventional abilities of Moscow and increased dependence on nuclear weapons."It was emphasized that the Russian forces would need years to rebuild after the losses they experienced in Ukraine.Therefore, "Russia will depend on nuclear weapons, cybernetics and space."

The interview reminds that in late summer last year, as a result of failures in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin publicly warned that Russia was ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia."Moscow is still developing long -range rockets that are able to carry nuclear weapons," we read.According to the Russian authorities, this, as emphasized in the report, has the opportunity to deter opponents.

The director of the US national intelligence Avril Haines also presented her intelligence assessments on Wednesday during interrogations in the American Senate.She emphasized that the authorities in the Kremlin believe in a military victory in Ukraine.

Avril Haines: Putin most likely calculates that time works in his favor

The director of the National Intelligence said that although Russia makes gradual progress in the Bachmut region, its armed forces struggle with large losses, staff shortages, ammunition deficiency, low morale and command dysfunction.- We do not anticipate that the Russian army regained enough strength this year to make larger territorial achievements, but Vladimir Putin most likely calculates that time works in his favor - said Avril Haines.She added that Ukraine also faces many challenges, and the success of the spring offensive will depend on many factors.In the opinion of the US intelligence services, Russia's nuclear threats are aimed at scaring the West from granting Ukraine additional support.- Probably Vladimir Putin is still convinced that Russia can ultimately defeat Ukraine, and wants to prevent Western support to tip the scales and forced the conflict with NATO - added the US national intelligence director.At the same time, she assessed that the invasion of Ukraine weakened Russia and made her even more dependent on China
