Sergei Lavrov on the end of the war in Ukraine

Journalists of "Compasu" sent questions to a Russian politician in which it was asked why the war in Ukraine has not yet ended.The interview was published on July 11 on the newspaper website.- The conflict in Ukraine will continue until the West abandons its plans to maintain dominance and obsession with causing Russia's strategic defeat through the puppet Kiev - answered Lavrov.



- So far, nothing indicates a change in their position and we see how America and its allies are still rushing to pump their weapons in Ukraine and push Vladimir Zełanski to continue the fighting - he added, spreading the Kremlin's propaganda in Indonesia.According to Lavrov, "Russia did not start aggression in Ukraine", and the United States and the European Union have made a "coup" in Kiev in 2014.The head of Russian diplomacy also added that the West urged Ukraine to resolve conflicts in Donbas by force - he referred to the rebellion of pro -Russian separatists in 2014.

War in Ukraine.Sergei Lavrov with Western sanctions

Sergei Lavrov also commented on the policy of the Ukrainian president.- Wołodymyr Zelnski was also a manifestation of the aggressive attitude of the Kiev regime and his supporters, who wanted to use the "room formula", considered the only possible way to solve - said the politician.- In fact, it was a series of demands directed against Russia, including the establishment of a special court to judge Russian military and political leaders and the confiscation of material goods as "war reparations" - added Lavrov.

The Russian minister said that Western policy and the economic sanctions imposed by him are "egoistic and undermine global food and energy security."- It is their actions that cause the suffering of countries that develop.Huge money that could be allocated to support international development, including the most needy countries, is currently burned in the form of thousands of tons of military equipment and ammunition supplied to Ukrainian neo -Nazi groups - said Ławrow.
