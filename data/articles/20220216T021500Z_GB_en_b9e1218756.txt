But US voters who admire Mr Putin and spoke to the BBC praised his boldness, while others were isolationists who believe the US should not deploy military forces abroad. Ultraconservatives in the Republican party are threatening political consequences for those who are perceived as overly aggressive and prone to using military force for the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Jonathan Erickson, who serves as a district chair for the Loudoun County Republican Committee in Virginia, is strongly opposed to Mr Biden's policies regarding Ukraine, and he supports Republican candidates who share his views.

"I don't want to send any of our people over there," said Mr Erickson. "We don't need to interject ourselves in every little conflict."

Amid the build-up of soldiers on Ukraine's borders, the US has moved 3,000 troops to Poland to protect Nato interests, but Mr Biden has sworn that there would be no American troops in Ukraine, which is not a Nato member.

Some Republicans say they do not trust Mr Putin, but are even more suspicious of Mr Biden and his "interventionist" policies.

Mr Putin's views of Ukraine, which has deep historical ties to Russia and was part of the former Soviet Union, are reasonable for Moscow, thinks Sohrab Ahmari, a contributing editor of the American Conservative. "Any Russian government would not like to see Nato right at Russia's doorstep - in Ukraine," he said.

Meanwhile, Mr Biden's responses to the public about the situation have been "confusing and unhelpful", said Mr Ahmari.

Eugene Delgaudio, a former county supervisor in Loudoun County, Virginia, thinks Mr Putin's threats are nothing more than "sabre-rattling". But regardless of what happens, "it's not in the interest of the US to go over there and defend Ukraine", said Mr Delgaudio.
