Conwoles, civilians and journalists for Russians in this war are also a target.The last example of this is the recording, which shows the moment of the Russian artillery attack on journalists and Ukrainian soldiers.In Ukraine, 28 journalists were killed in Ukraine, including seven foreigners.

The work of journalists in Ukraine is extremely dangerous.The best example of this is the last situation in which the artillery shell exploded right next to a group of reporters from Ukrainian and foreign media.One of Ukrainian journalists was wounded.It was necessary to put on a pressure band.- If a man is wearing the inscription "press", then he automatically becomes the target for Russian occupiers, because he shows their crimes.It's simple - explains Andrij Kowalienko from the Ukrainian press academy.

In Ukraine, 28 journalists were killed in Ukraine, including seven foreigners.Recently - reporter and camera operator French television BFM Frederic Lecler -Imhoff.- He wasn't a riskyard.He always assessed and decided where to go and where not - recalls Marc -Olivier Fogiel, general director of BFM television.The reporter was traveling with a humanitarian convoy, which was to evacuate civilian inhabitants of the Lugansk region.The convoy was shelled by artillery.The blade of the bullet hit the journalist in the neck.

- It is disgusting that journalists and humanitarian convoys are targeted deliberately and they are clearly war crimes.It is disgusting that in this conflict there is no respect even for the Geneva Convention - says Christophe Deloire, director of the organization "Reporters without borders".

Tuesday is the 97th day of Russian aggression on Ukraine.Currently, the heaviest fights are fought for Siewierodoniec.- A few days ago, the Russians assured that they had conquered the city.It's not true.Our boys are still there and they resist them.Street fights are underway - assures Serhij Hajdaj, head of the authorities of the Lugansk region.However, part of the city, which had 120,000 inhabitants before the war, was occupied by the Russians.

Weapon need

Ukrainians repeat that they will not be able to defeat Russians without powerful rocket artillery systems.The decision whether such launchers will hit the hands of Ukrainian soldiers is to be announced this week. - We are not going to send rocket systems to Ukraine that can reach Russia - says Joe Biden.However, the launchers can be launched both rockets with a range of 300 kilometers, but also flying only up to 70 kilometers - but very precise.- If they do not intend to deliver 300 kilometers rockets, then only at the current stage.We are enough for us for 70 kilometers now - argues Oleksij Astowycz, adviser to the President of Ukraine.

If there is no supply, Russian artilleryists will still be able to fire Ukrainian cities with civilian residents with almost impunity.

Ukrainian prosecutors already have names of 600 people who could commit war crimes in Ukraine.
