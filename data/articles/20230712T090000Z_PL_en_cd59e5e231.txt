Zacharowa: Ukraine is not invited to NATO, because Poland wants to invade

Another amazement may be caused by another theses, which was given by a spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Zacharów stated that NATO does not offer Ukraine membership in the Alliance, because "Poland considers Western Ukraine as part of its territory and intends to invade."- Currently, there is an obvious desire for Poland to invade the western part of Ukraine.That is why Ukraine is not invited to NATO - she said.

- NATO is certainly involved in confrontation with Russia.We talk about it every day that in relation to Russia they began a hybrid war, which means military confrontation, sanctions, pressure, political pressure against Russia - the spokeswoman said.

As she said, "there is no Russian -Ukrainian conflict" - it does not exist because Ukraine is used by NATO, primarily by the US and Great Britain, as an instrument to influence Russia - she said, adding that Western countries "believe that they haveThe moral right to ensure political dominance in the world. "

Zacharowa: Russia is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the UN Security Council

She assured that "Russian understanding of security and security guarantees was based on the understanding of international law, which includes the United Nations card and the entire package of documents developed by the UN Security Council."

- This is our understanding of how to build peace and how the world should be built - she assured that Russia has observed international principles.Zacharów, however, did not mention the war crimes of Russia, and above all attacks on civilians whose Putin troops have committed in Ukraine since the full -scale war.

- I agree with those who say that international law is violated in Ukraine.I really support this statement, but the question is when it was violated, and it was in 2014, when in Kiev, an unconstitutional coup was carried out - said the spokeswoman, stating that then Russia was not attacked by Ukraine, but "USA, the United Kingdom, Great Britain,France, Germany, Poland and the Baltic States have united to overthrow the Ukrainian authorities and lead to power those they support. "

The Russian independent media, commenting on the course of the NATO summit, emphasize that Ukraine did not receive an invitation to membership in the alliance.At the same time, they pay attention to the declarations of individual countries regarding the increase in supply of weapons.

Journalist of Russian independent television "Rain" Jekaterina Kotrikadze, reporting from Vilnius the course of the NATO summit, talked about the possible disappointment of Ukrainians by the lack of a decision on membership.- All representatives of NATO countries repeat in Vilnius that Ukraine will enter the alliance.However, we have heard such promises since the peak in Bucharest in 2008.15 years have passed since then - the journalist emphasized.

In turn, the Ukrainian military expert Serhij Grabski said on Radio Svoboda that so far the peak findings should be satisfactory for Ukraine.- A critical point has been exceeded, from which there is no return and Ukraine will be a member of the alliance, which is why I am satisfied with the effects of the first part of the NATO summit - said the Ukrainian expert.Grabski added that the Ukrainian army has been taking action for integration with NATO systems for many years.At the same time, he admitted that Kiev must still adapt his legal and political system to the standards of European democracy.
