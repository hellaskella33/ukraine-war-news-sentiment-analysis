France is to support Ukraine’s bid to one day join Nato in an attempt to pressure Russia into negotiating an end to its war, according to French reports – amid concern Kyiv will struggle to liberate all its territory.

France and Germany blocked any prospect of Ukraine’s rapid accession to Nato in 2008, against the advice of the United States, which at the time advocated its integration.

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, stuck to this stance both before and after the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022.

“Ukraine’s entry into Nato would be perceived by Russia as something confrontational. You can’t imagine it with this kind of Russia,” he told Le Monde in December 2022.

However, during a defence council meeting at the Elysée Palace on June 12, Mr Macron and his government reconsidered the possibility of Kyiv joining the alliance, according to the French newspaper.

Defending that position as a “means of influencing the conflict and bringing Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table is the approach now favoured by France in the delicate discussions between Ukraine’s allies in the run-up to the annual Nato summit” due to be held next month, the newspaper reported.
