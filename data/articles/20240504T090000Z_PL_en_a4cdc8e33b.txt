Most of these assets are in Europe.Their freezing occurred as part of the sanctions imposed by the G7 countries after Russia's attack on Ukraine in February 2022. Among them are the assets of the Russian Central Bank, including securities and cash worth approximately EUR 260 billion.

Initially, Washington proposed a confiscation of these assets.This idea was discussed during the meeting of G7 finance ministers, but there was no breakthrough.In a statement issued after the meeting, the G7 countries confirmed their determination that Russia would pay for damages caused by Ukraine.Until then, Russia's assets will remain frozen.

What is the situation on the front?

Meanwhile, the situation on the Ukrainian front is disturbing.The Ukrainian forces, which are struggling with a lack of people and ammunition, are slowly pushed west after the Russians captured the city of Awdijwka in the Donetsk region in February.

The deputy head of the Ukrainian military intelligence, General Wadym Skibicki, assessed that the current situation of Ukraine is the most difficult than the beginning of the full -scale Russian invasion and may still get worse.According to him, Russia wants to "get something" before the celebration of the Victory Day on May 9.

Ukraine is currently waiting for the supply of American military assistance, which according to experts is of key importance for further stopping the Russian invasion.The package of funds worth $ 60.8 billion, providing for support for Ukraine, was adopted in the American Congress after over half a year of internal disputes.
