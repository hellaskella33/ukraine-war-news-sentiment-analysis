MINSK, 26 April (BelTA) - The Military Doctrine and the National Security Concept of Belarus are highly topical documents, Deputy Head of the Belarus President Administration Vladimir Pertsov told the media on 26 April, BelTA has learned.“The major topic on the agenda of the seventh Belarusian People’s Congress, the first one held in the constitutional status, was the Military Doctrine and the National Security Concept,” the deputy head of the Belarus President Administration said. “These are highly topical documents and there is no need to make any long explanations here. We are watching what is happening now on the geopolitical map of the world. Tectonic changes, hot spots that are emerging in the Middle East, and in the territories that are considered to be territories of the People's Republic of China. There is a hot conflict in Ukraine, which, as the president said, the United States are trying to shift to our country. Here we must take all measures and develop strategic documents, because our military agency and the State Secretariat of the Security Council know how to implement them tactically, know what should be done. We are sure that all the necessary measures are being taken in this area.”In order to develop a conceptual, strategic approach, these issues were brought to a broad discussion of the Belarusian People’s Congress, Vladimir Pertsov said. “The discussion of the issues was broadcast on national television. At the moment when our opponents or potential adversaries, who in their military doctrines have already described us as geopolitical rivals and even potential adversaries, do everything in secret, we bring such issues to the public discussion,” he said.
