Russian arguments

In an interview with Truss, Lavrov argued that "Russia's arguments" fell on unprepared ground.As he said, "according to his feelings, British colleagues were either not familiar with Russian arguments or completely ignore them."Referring to the issue of "security guarantee", which the Kremlin demands from the west, the minister stated that "contact points did not outlined."

Lavrov accused the Western countries that they "treat" justified fears of Russia "and" selectively approach their obligations within the OSCE ".He emphasized that Russia intends to continue communicating, primarily with the United States, in the case of the security guarantee it requested, but is interested in a "specific reaction", and not - as he put it - "excuses" from the West.

The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also referred to trade union exercises-2022, held at Belarusian training grounds.As he said, they cause "incomprehensible anxiety" of Western countries.He repeated the argument of Moscow that her army - whose concentration at the borders of Ukraine causes the anxiety of the West - are on her own territory.

Truss: Facts speak for themselves

For its part, Truss maintained that "Russia still has the opportunity to stop aggression at Ukraine and stick to the diplomatic path of agreement."- The facts speak for themselves.We see an increase in the number of soldiers and weapons on the border with Ukraine and we consider it a threat.We also see a hybrid war and other types aimed at undermining democracy in Ukraine - the British minister emphasized.And she added.- Russia has a choice, can follow a diplomatic path and cooperate with NATO, or continue the path we see.

Truss reported that Lavrov told her at a meeting that Russia had no plans to invade Ukraine."However, we would like these words to be supported by specific actions," she said.In this context, she mentioned the removal of forces and equipment gathered by Russia at the border with Ukraine.

The head of British diplomacy at a press conference also accused Russia of aggressive behavior.She emphasized that Russia's diplomacy should not disturb Ukraine in deciding about its future.She warned that the war against Ukraine would be a long conflict, Kiev allies would introduce sanctions, and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would not be launched.
