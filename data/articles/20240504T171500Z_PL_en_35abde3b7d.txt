Sikorski: Putin would do well if he considered the invasion of an error

Radosław Sikorski also noted in an interview with BBC World that Poland spends the largest part of GDP in NATO on defense - 4 percent."We can spend more next year," he declared.Referring to the situation in Ukraine, he thanked the US President and Congress for accepting a help package.He estimated that Ukraine "desperately needs anti -aircraft shells to protect its industry, to protect its power plants to protect its infrastructure."

- I think that it is much better to spend money on defense of Ukraine than to have to rebuild it later (...) I think that President Putin would do well if he considered his invasion of a mistake and made a new calculation, taking into account that we will help Ukraine for so long, as necessary - he noted.According to Sikorski, the war could only end with Putin's recognition that the costs of war are not worth achieving his goals.
