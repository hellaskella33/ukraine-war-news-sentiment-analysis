Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's Ukraine “peace proposal” will likely be discussed during meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.

“Alexander Grigoryevich [Lukashenko] will likely consider it necessary to provide clarifications on this matter. Then, of course, they will exchange views," Peskov said during a regular call with journalists.

Last Friday, Lukashenko called for a freezing of “hostilities” in Ukraine and restrict the movement of equipment and weapons from both sides, which both Russia and Ukraine quickly rejected.

Lukashenko is expected to arrive for talks in Moscow on Wednesday. The two leaders will discuss issues of bilateral cooperation ahead of a Supreme Council of the Union State of Russia and Belarus meeting on Thursday.

Lukashenko has also said he intensified talks with Putin about deploying both tactical and strategic — more powerful — nuclear weapons to deal with threats from Ukraine’s Western allies, who he claimed are planning a coup against him.
