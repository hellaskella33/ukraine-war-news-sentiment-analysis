Chinese President XI Jinping is concerned about Russian aggression on Ukraine, partly because of the increased unity of the West, and partly because - as it seems - his services did not predict that the invasion would occur - assessed CIA director William Burns.He added that Russia converted, hoping for China's help in connection with sanctions.

Performing the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in front of the Senate intelligence committee (CIA) assessed that although China will certainly not abandon close relations with Russia because of how much they have invested in them, they are concerned about Russian aggression on Ukraine.

CIA boss: Putin has miscalculated

- I think that Chinese leadership, and especially President XI, are concerned about what they see, partly because his own interview seems to not tell him what will happen - said Burns.He added that China is also afraid of damage to their reputation in connection with the Russian invasion, the economic consequences of sanctions imposed on Russia, but also to strengthen transatlantic relations.

According to the head of the CI, Russian President Vladimir Putin converted, hoping that China would significantly help him to alleviate the effects of restrictions.He also expressed the opinion that Russia would not be able to keep the "information bubble" she created in the country with the help of propaganda in the matter of war.He estimated that at some point the effects of the conflict - both economic and human losses, and destruction in Ukraine - would be impossible to ignore.

Burns added that although in the past the US was losing "information war" to Russia, this time Russia is losing, among others due to the American intelligence of Russian actions in Ukraine in advance.
