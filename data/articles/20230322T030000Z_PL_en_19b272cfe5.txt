"I'm afraid to ride on this route. But what to do? Such service."Ukrainian trains were not even stopped by the war

On trains, the Ukrainians feel safe, because the Cruvage has always been a mainstay of normality and confidence in the country, where from the announcement of independence in 1991 hardly worked normally.Even the war did not change that.I found out about it, traveling thousands of kilometers on Ukrainian trains and spending hundreds of hours in them.







Five minutes, 19 minutes, hour, hour and 46 minutes, two hours - only in one week, between March 8 and 15.PKP Intercity "Orzeszkowa" trained on March 14 came from Jelenia Góra to Warsaw with a delay of 106 minutes.The composition of Intercity "Malczewski" from Kraków to Kołobrzeg on March 8, reaching Wrocław, already had 119 minutes delay.In addition, on TVN Warszawa I read that "at the Warsaw railway node (...) the manager of the railway infrastructure has canceled eight connections of the S40 line from Piaseczno and from Warsaw Main (...).The next seven were shortened. "This is what rail reality looks like in Poland, a country living in peace, a member state of the European Union.

Ukraine lies behind its eastern border, in which a regular war has been going on for over a year.Russian soldiers shelter trains and railway stations, rockets fall on energy infrastructure facilities, depriving the traction of electricity, and there are no shortage of mines and unexploded bubbles.And yet Ukrainian railwaymen give advice - sometimes one would like to say that their trains run like in a Swiss watch.

I often travel Ukrainian trains since November.Only one composition I was late was late - from Kiev to the liberated in September Izium in the east of Ukraine.After a massive rocket attack in Ukraine in the morning of March 9, we stood at the station in Kharkov and a half hours longer than the schedule predicted.- Only 15 rockets flew on Kharkiv.There is no electricity in traction.We are waiting for us to allocate a combustion locomotive, because the electric one will not go - the conductor explained to me when I went out to light a cigarette.

Fear at the station in Cherson

Kersonie train station.There are over 20 wagons along the platform.It is still winter, but here - in the south of Ukraine - when the sun comes out, it gets warm.Only every now and then explosions can be heard.Like in stereo - once bangs on the left, after a while on the right.The locals are accustomed to this, because the Russians from the opposite shore of the Dnieper shoot by Kersoń almost without interruption.

Each wagon is looked after by a conductor or conductor, called guides.They make sure that the wagon is warm, spreading bedding, coffee, tea, closes to the toilets at stops so that the passengers do not use them, because most wagons do not have a closed water circulation and impurities flow on the tracks.The guides and guides also check tickets and let in the wagons.

The Russian missile just hit closer to the station in Cherson.The guides and guides raise their shoulders as if they wanted to put their heads in them.No wonder, they came here for a moment from other regions of Ukraine, where fire is not so common.- I'm afraid to ride this route.You hear how they shoot.But what to do?This is our service - a guide from the fourth wagon tells me.
