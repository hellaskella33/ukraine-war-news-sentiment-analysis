Russia must end the war in eastern Ukraine immediately, and any attempt to increase aggression will have severe consequences for the Kremlin.

Juri Ratas, chairman of the Estonian parliament, said this at a joint briefing with his Ukrainian counterpart Ruslan Stefanchuk in Kyiv on Tuesday, February 8, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.

"Security is a priority today. The democratic world has no doubt that Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence are unconditional. Invasion of an independent country is a gross violation of international law. The war in Donbas, which has been going on for eight years, must be stopped immediately. Any attempt to increase aggression will have severe consequences [for Russia]," Ratas said.

He added that since regaining its independence 30 years ago, Estonia has pledged never to be alone and has worked hard to become a reliable ally and partner in building collective security.

"We are aware of the importance and value of cooperation between democracies. We promise Ukraine: 'You will never be left alone'," Ratas said.
