Russian forces must be pushed out of "the whole of Ukraine", the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said.

In a keynote speech in London, Ms Truss said victory for Ukraine was now a "strategic imperative" for the West.

This amounts to the clearest statement yet of Britain's war aims which have, until now, been limited to stating that President Putin's invasion of Ukraine "must fail and be seen to fail".

She said Western allies must "double down" in their support for Ukraine.

"We will keep going further and faster," Ms Truss said, "to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine."

This implies that Russian forces must leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks since their invasion on 24 February but also those areas they invaded and annexed eight years ago, such as Crimea in the south and parts of the eastern Donbas region.

A month into this latest invasion, Russia declared its main goal was the "liberation of Donbas" - broadly referring to Ukraine's regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.

More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian proxy forces in a war that began in 2014.

Not all western powers may share Ms Truss' ambitious target, fearing it is unlikely to be achieved either by arms or negotiation.

Some French and German officials have been more cautious about stating war aims that risk provoking Russia, preferring to focus instead on language about defending Ukraine.

The foreign secretary's latest remarks in a speech at Mansion House in London reflect the desire by some in the West to aim high, so that Ukraine enters any possible future talks about a political settlement to the conflict with the best negotiating hand possible.
