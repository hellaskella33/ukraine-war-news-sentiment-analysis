However, it is now likely the second attack by the North Vietnamese never happened.

The captain of a US naval destroyer initially reported he was being surrounded and fired on by enemy torpedo boats but later said that because of bad weather and low visibility that he could not be sure he had been.

Declassified documents released in 2005 suggest the North Vietnamese navy was not attacking the US ship, external but trying to salvage two of the boats damaged on 2 August.

However, President Lyndon B. Johnson and staff decided to believe the initial version of events and presented the incidents to Congress as two unprovoked attacks on US forces by North Vietnam.

It led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which allowed President Johnson to start bombing raids on North Vietnam and greatly escalate US military involvement in the Vietnam War.
