While the war on Ukraine has gone on for months, both Russian and western military analysts believed Putin’s army could take the whole country in less than a week. In 1939, Russia and Stalin invaded another neighbor, Finland, and they too believed they could be victorious in just a few days. Like today’s conflict, the world was shocked by how the Finnish fought off Russia. A new FOX Nation documentary, The Winter War, examines how the 1939 conflict foreshadowed the current aggression against Ukraine. Dr. Roger Reese, a history professor at Texas A&M, is featured in the FOX Nation special and he joins the FOX News Rundown: War in Ukraine to discuss the parallels between the Russia’s attack on Finland and its current invasion.
