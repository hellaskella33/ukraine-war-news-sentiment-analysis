Joe Biden has told Volodymyr Zelensky he will "move quickly" to send Ukraine fresh military aid, after US lawmakers passed a $61bn (£49bn) support package.

The House of Representatives approved the bill on Saturday after months of political gridlock in the chamber.

Mr Biden promised "significant" support for Kyiv - including more air defences - if senators approve the bill as expected on Tuesday.

The assurances come as Russian attacks destroyed a TV tower in Kharkiv.

Footage showed the red and white tower collapsing seconds after Russian missiles slammed into it on Monday afternoon in the eastern Ukrainian city, which lies just 19 miles (30km) from the Russian border.

Local officials said there were no casualties in the attack, with regional Governor Oleg Syniehubov writing on social media that staff were in a shelter at the time.

But Mr Syniehubov said the attack had disrupted television broadcasting in the region.

Kharkiv has been targeted in relentless air attacks by Russian forces in recent weeks. In a social media post after the attack, President Zelensky wrote that it was "Russia's clear intention to make the city uninhabitable".

He added that he had informed President Biden of the strike, which he said happened just before their call on Monday.

In a readout of the call released by the White House, President Biden said his administration had a "lasting commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom against Russian aggression".

The White House also said Mr Biden had committed to helping Ukraine "maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration".

The aid package approved by the House on Saturday includes more than $9bn (£7.28bn) of economic assistance in the form of "forgivable loans" - ones that do not need to be paid back.
