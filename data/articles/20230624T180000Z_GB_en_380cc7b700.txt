"Patrushev is the most hawkish hawk, thinking the West has been out to get Russia for years," says Ben Noble, associate professor of Russian politics at University College London.

He is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him ever since the 1970s in St Petersburg, when Russia's second city was still known as Leningrad.

The other two stalwarts are security service chief Alexander Bortnikov and foreign intelligence head Sergei Naryshkin. All the president's inner circle are known as siloviki, or enforcers, but this trio are closer still.

Few hold as much influence over the president as Nikolai Patrushev. Not only did he work with him in the old KGB during the communist era, he replaced him as head of its successor organisation, the FSB, from 1999 to 2008.

It was during a bizarre meeting of Russia's security council, three days before the invasion, that Mr Patrushev pushed his view that the US's "concrete goal" was the break-up of Russia.

He has since accused the US of preparing "biological war", and Washington and London of leading the West in the hope of defeating Russia.

When the Kakhovka dam was blown up in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine in a suspected Russian attack, he blamed Ukraine, backed up by the US, UK and their Nato allies.

"He's the one who has the chief battle cry, and there's a sense in which Putin has moved towards his more extreme position," says Ben Noble.
