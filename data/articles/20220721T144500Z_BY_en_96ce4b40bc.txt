MINSK, 21 July (BelTA) â€“ Internal reasons have been growing recently in Ukraine to aggravate the relations with Russia, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said in an interview with AFP in Minsk on 21 July, BelTA has learned.

According to the president, in recent years internal reasons have been growing in Ukraine to aggravate the relations with Russia. For example, the Ukrainian authorities deliberately limited the use of the Russian language, insulted and demonized the Russian leadership, the head of state noted.

"Ukraine's domestic policy forced Russia's hand, roughly speaking. Why did they insult the Russian authorities, President Putin? They didn't criticize Macron, although there were reasons for it. When Biden tripped and fell, no one in Belarus laughed at it. Things do happen. I understand: a man was running and tripped. He should not have been running in the first place. But things happen, as I said. But the things you are saying against Putin. Why are you demonizing him, why are you insulting him? I mean, this does not contribute to creating a good environment. This is not the reason for the operation, of course, but the atmospherics is not good," Aleksandr Lukashenko said.

The main thing here, the president emphasized, is that no one gives Russia security guarantees. No one guarantees it that no aggression will come from the territory of Ukraine. "You, NATO and the United States, needed the war. You did everything to the hilt to create this situation, to goad it on ," the head of state summed up.
