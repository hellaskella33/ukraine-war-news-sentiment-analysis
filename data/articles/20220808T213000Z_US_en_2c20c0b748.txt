Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN)- The US Deputy Minister of Defense for Political Affairs, Collin Cole, revealed American estimates of Russia's losses due to the war in Ukraine.

"Russia has about 70 to 80,000 losses (between a dead and wounded) so far in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia," Collin Cole said in a press statement, noting that this number includes both the Russian forces that were killed and wounded during the fighting.

â€œI think it is safe to suggest that the Russians may have killed 70 or 80,000 victims in less than six months. Now this is a mixture of dead and wounded, this number may be a little lower, and slightly higher, but I think this is a kind of on the field".

Cole said that the number of victims from the Russian forces was "striking", given that Russia "has not achieved any of Vladimir Putin's goals" since the invasion of Ukraine at the end of February.

"The morale and the Ukrainian will to fight is indisputable, and I think it is much higher than the average will to fight on the Russian side, so I think this gives the Ukrainians a great advantage."
