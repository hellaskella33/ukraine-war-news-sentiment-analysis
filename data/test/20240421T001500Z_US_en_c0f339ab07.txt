The last U.S. aid bill for Ukraine was approved in December 2022 when Democrats still controlled both houses of Congress. The Biden administration has been requesting another aid package, with growing urgency, since last August. Now, nearly four months after almost all U.S. aid shipments ran out, the Republican-controlled House finally approved on Saturday a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine as part of a larger foreign-assistance package. This would seem to vindicate the aphorism (often wrongly attributed to Winston Churchill) that America can always be counted on to do the right thing after having exhausted all the alternatives.
