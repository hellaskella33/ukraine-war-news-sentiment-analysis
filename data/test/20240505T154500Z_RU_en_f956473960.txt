These would be two "red lines" of NATO for their direct intervention in the Ukrainian conflict

At the same time, for the moment there are no operational plans to send the block soldiers to the Ukrainian territory, but only evaluations of possible actions in case of pessimistic scenarios.

During highly confidential conversations, NATO has established at least two red lines that if they crossed would take to the countries of the block to intervene directly in the Ukrainian conflict and send their troops to help the Kiev regime, the Italian newspaper reports the repubblica.

"Red lines"

According to the medium data, the first "red line" refers to the possibility of rupture of kyiv's defense lines and the direct or indirect involvement of a third.It is pointed out that Ukraine is no longer able to fully control its long border with Russia, so there is concerns that the Russian army can break the defense in the northwest.

In this case, the possibility of creating a corridor between Ukraine and Belarus would open, and then Minsk would be directly involved in the conflict."His troops and his arsenal would be a decisive factor for Moscow," says the newspaper.

The second line is an alleged "military provocation" against Poland or the Baltic states, as well as an attack against Moldova.At the same time, it is pointed out that it should not be "necessarily an invasion", but of a military offensive to "test the reaction of the West."

"NATO is willing to intervene to avoid kyiv's collapse"

The repubblica also states that in the European capitals the possibility of the defeat of the Ukrainian army is no longer excluded and that is why, in the newspaper it is indicated, that it is vital for European leaders to make Russia clear that one thing is to penetrate deeply in theEastern territories and another, which cannot be allowed, is the control of the capital."In other words: Ukraine cannot lose and the Atlantic Alliance is willing to intervene directly to avoid kyiv's collapse," he emphasizes.

He also adds that if the military block finally decides to get involved, he could deploy about 100,000 soldiers, found in Hungary, Poland, Baltic states, Romania and Slovakia.However, in the event that the block is finally involved, the air forces would be used first, while terrestrial troops would only be sent as "last resort."

At the same time, the newspaper emphasizes that at the moment there are no operational plans that foresee the sending of the alliance soldiers to the Ukrainian territory, but only evaluations of possible actions in pessimistic scenarios.
